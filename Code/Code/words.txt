They just moved in from a temporary location. My wife and I assumed it was the Metro area office, but it's for the whole state. They held an opening party and I would say it was well attended, and very diverse along many dimensions (sex, race, age, occupation). It probably shouldn't be a surprise that the demographics line up well for them in that area, but I would have guessed that most of the campaign HQ's would be in Raleigh. Not trying to turn this into a political discussion per se, just thought it was interesting.
"Hello all! Big news this week! We are adding [Wooden Robot Brewing](http://woodenrobotbrewery.com/?age-verified=af893fcc03) to the rotation of breweries! They just recently added Tuesdays to their hours. I have been unable to find information on the food truck they are having (or if they are having one) though they usually have one for the weekends. I will update if I find out more. If not I hope to see you all at Wooden Robot for our first meetup there!**EDIT:** The food truck will be Wooden Robot's [Twisted Eats](http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/akmxGnM8f6onvyPFvebZWA/o.jpg) I can say from experience that they have quite the interesting menu.

"I am moving today and have an IKEA PAX wardrobe system that I can't take with me. It is a dark brown color and is in great shape.

The wardrobe is a rather large item so a truck or van would be necessary. It won't fit in a regular sedan sized car. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions. Thanks!EDIT: Hi all, the wardrobe has been claimed.  Thank you."

I'm going down for an interview in Raleigh next week, and I honestly don't know much about that area. Is it comparable to Charlotte? How is it better or worse?

"You ask how has the FBI not taken on the I-77 issue.  Who knows.  maybe they have.  But remember two important facts about this deal.  1) The primary holder of equity in the deal is TIFIA (i.e. the US Dept of Transportation2) The current US Sec of Transportation is Governor McCrory's successor as mayor of Charlotte, Anthony Foxx.

Looking to do something special for my wife for our anniversary this year. We got married on Leap Day so this will be our 3rd actual anniversary but married 12 years.

I had a lady that used to come around South Blvd with flowers for sale that used to do it for me but I cant find her any more :( So my question for you reddit is if you know of a place that will dye them for me.

"**When:** Most Tuesday nights, from 5:30 until 9:30. Next session is tomorrow, the 26th.**Where:** [Get Some Game](http://www.getsomegame.com/), A local game store. If you have trouble finding it, I'll try to provide extra directions. I may also be able to provide transportation depending on your own location.**What you need:** Honestly, just a character sheet and a pencil, and even those I can provide if needed. Optional goodies are the player's handbook for convenience, and your own set of dice (though I have a few that can be used. All you really need is a good attitude and a love for roleplaying games.**Character Creation:** You're allowed to use any class or race option made available by Wizards of the Coast, including their Unearthed Arcana resources. This is fifth edition. If you're new, then I and the other players can help you out with character creation when you show up. If you'd like to make the character ahead of time, we're using standard array/27 point buy. DO NOT roll the character's stats.**Current Party:** I won't go into detail about their stories as that's up to the players themselves how much they divulge and when. The current make up is a Human Ranger who dual wields swords, a Halfling Arcane Trickster Rogue, and a Drow/Dark Elf Monk Assassin. There is also a Half-Elf Bard, though she is unfortunately an infrequent player at the moment and occupies essentially a guest spot. I'd prefer new players not have classes already being used, but as long as there's enough difference between them, it's not a major issue.**Setting:** Details [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3l8kl7/the_world_for_my_dd_campaign_setting_sabah_a_land/) if you're interested in the read. Long story short, the story takes place post-apocalyptic magical war. It's a homebrew setting, so you don't need to know anything about the other D&D worlds. We're making plenty up as we go, so if there's an aspect you're interested in that hasn't been explored yet, you can bring it up so it can be incorporated into the campaign.That's about it. If there's any questions, then please let me know. The group is incredibly easy going and laid back. Every single person in the group so far has been completely new to either D&D or this particular edition, so we're all very newbie friendly. I can run at most about 7 players, and currently only have 3 (possibly 4) regulars. Not being able to show up for a session isn't a big deal and your character will quickly be caught up with the rest of the party."

I've rebooted all hardware and unplugged/replugged all cables (heck I even checked the connections outside the house) more times than I can remember, nothing has fixed it I think it's an outage of some sort in the area but TWC must program their flunkies to never admit if there's an outage.

When the power went out in 2002 there were no gas stations that had working pumps unless you drove for awhile (assuming the roads were open and clear).It's going to get dark.  DAMN dark.  Like you've never seen it dark.  You may want to make sure you have flash lights, batteries and/or candles.You may want to contact relatives and establish a contact plan.  When the power goes out regionally, and for awhile, things like cell towers start to go offline.You may want to ready a bug-out kit in case you decide to leave your home for warmer shelter.  The kit should include some cash, medicines, change of clothes, toothbrush/paste and such.Put a tarp or something over your windshield.  I can assure you, scraping off a half inch of ice off your windshield is a BITCH.For the love of all things holy, don't try to warm your place up with a BBQ grill.  Seriously.  You do that, and you won't have to worry about using that grill ever again.Here's info on the 2002 storm - some areas saw up to 3/4"" of an inch of ice which made it particularly ugly.http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nwsfo/storage/cases/20021204/"

I just recently relocated here from Florida to Davidson.

"Maybe you weren't drunk. Maybe you have a medical condition. Your head was tilted back and to the right. Your mouth was open like you were snoring away. I knew something was amiss when the light turned green and you didn't move. We pulled around you and over to the side of the road. My boyfriend got out of the car and banged on the window of your SUV. A van pulled aside and blared his horn in an effort to wake you up. My boyfriend noticed that your car was still in drive and your foot was on the brake pedal. He decided to call the cops. When the first officer got there she was finally able to rouse you from your sleep. Instead of putting the car in park like she asked you attempted to drive off. You were disoriented. You finally put the car in park and stumbled out. That's when we left, when we knew that you were safe and that everyone else on the road was. You were still in your white dress shirt and tie. Perhaps you went out with coworkers and had a bit too much fun. Maybe you were blowing off steam. But now you're more than likely nursing one hell of a hangover in Mecklenburg County Jail and don't exactly know how you got there. On our way home my boyfriend expressed that he felt slightly guilty about being a 'tattletale'. I don't feel guilty at all though. You could have killed someone. You could have killed yourself. Had your foot slipped off the brake pedal you would have driven straight into the mellow mushroom. All because you were so impaired that you didn't think to call a cab or hire an Ã_ber. You probably hate us right now, my boyfriend and me. But I hope that this very costly experience will be your wake up call. Perhaps you're an addict and maybe now you'll get help. Or at least not drink and drive anymore.Either way, your family isn't planning your funeral and the people you could have killed are still alive. I guess I'm writing this because I hope you're a redditor and that you'll see it. I hope you know that we weren't  out to ruin your night. We just couldn't, in good conscience, just say nothing and let you sit there passed out while the light turned from red to green again."

"What are the main reason people are opposed to toll lanes?Several reasons, provided by u/turkey_slap, in no particular order...* They're not your typical toll/express lanes where that you pay a small price to use. Pricing will be varied based on congestion in the general purpose lanes. The more congested the general lanes are, the more it will cost to use the toll lanes. It could cost $.05 a mile or $1.00 a mile.* The lanes will not be built or managed by NCDOT or the NC Turnpike Authority. A Spanish company named Cintra will build the lanes. In exchange for building them, they will keep all profits for 50 years.* During that 50 year life of the contract, NC will not be allowed to widen, or add more capacity (general purpose lanes), to I-77 without paying a penalty to Cintra.* If toll revenues fail to meet projected profits, the state of NC (i.e., taxpayers) must reimburse Cintra for the lost revenue.* NC taxpayers are contributing around $100 million to the project. If one general purpose lane was added to I-77 between exits 23 and 36 - where congestion is the worst - it the cost likely wouldn't exceed that $100 million amount.* NC pays one of the highest gas taxes in the US. Gas taxes are supposed to go to pay for road construction. NCDOT is funding many other multi-million dollar road construction projects across the state in places that are much less populated. The Charlotte is and has been one of the fastest growing areas in the US for several years. They claim that they don't have the money to improve I-77, but can somehow fund these other projects.* NCDOT refuses to score the I-77 widening project with their new 'objective' scoring formula. Likewise, when they proposed this project, they insisted that the entire stretch from the Lake Norman area down to Charlotte be included (rather than just scoring the area between exits ~19 and 36). This inflated the projected cost of the project.* The toll lanes will not allow tractor trailers in them and will not be constructed with concrete thick enough to handle their weight.* The existing HOV lanes from Charlotte to Exit 23 will turned into toll/HOT lanes. NC taxpayers already paid for these lanes. They are essentially being given to Cintra for profit.* The current passenger requirement for HOV lanes is 2 people in a vehicle. This will be increased to 3 people for the HOT/toll lanes and will only be ""free"" if your vehicle is equipped with a transponder.* There is a lot of collusion and political corruption being uncovered with regard to this whole project. Most of it is centered around Thom Tillis and Gov McCrory.* These lanes are a Public Private Partnership (P3) and seen by many as part of the Republican agenda to privatize public resources. P3's came about, in part, from ALEC (the Koch Brothers) which is essentially an organization which crafts model legislation and passes it off to state legislatures to sign into law.* Cintra has declared bankruptcies on two other toll road projects in the US - Indiana and Texas. Their projections for profit on I-77 would make this toll road the highest grossing toll road in the US, which is completely unrealistic.I think that covers the most salient points. I'm sure I forgot some, but that should give the basics.**EDIT 1/12/16**From the recent vote, per u/lollylewlaylow :* Four council members â€“ Democrats Claire Fallon, Al Austin and LaWana Mayfield and Republican Kenny Smith â€“ voted against directing its CRTPO member, Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, to support the toll lanes.* Voting in favor of toll lanes were Republican Ed Driggs and Democrats John Autry, Patsy Kinsey, Julie Eiselt, Vi Lyles, James Mitchell and Greg Phipps.**EDIT 1/13/16**[This map](http://i.imgur.com/x9i7ooP.png) was made by u/zverkalt showing which representative corresponds to each district, color coded by votes for and against.[This graph](https://i.imgur.com/yqMd1fD.png) made by u/USSDoyle shows Cintra's profit projections for I77 vs. other metropolitan areas with toll roads.

I'll have time for dinner while there and it'd be fun to get some good eats. Thanks a bunch y'all! "

"When I was younger I was homeschooled and my mother was a book reseller, and over the years I've accumulated a bunch of books ranging from young children books to high school books, some for pleasure reading and some for educational reading.Are there any good local places (I live by Concord Mills mall) for me to donate these books that will actually be handed out to kids so they can read and appreciate them?"




"Let me start off by saying I do not work at Hendrick Honda, I just bought a car and I want to share how awesome it is there. There is a referral program, but I'll keep my name out so you know this is just me talking about an awesome time. We've had a relationship with Hendrick Honda for a long time. About 8 years ago, when we had an odyssey, they did us a huge favor. The transmission in our van completely died. Like. $7k put a new one in. The service manager there knew us, and knew that my mom was in the middle of a medical crisis. We told him we just didn't have the money, and we were ready to just give up the van. He said ""Give me a few hours"" and somewhere down the line, the Hendrick family actually stepped in and said, ""Don't worry about it"" and fixed up our van, pro bono. Now that was 8 YEARS AGO. Alot can change, and its been 5 years since we've owned a Honda. I had a $7k budget to buy a used reliable car to get me to and from college. I doubted I would find something like that at a dealer. I walk in, tell them my exact budget, and they hooked me up. A 2006 civic that was originally priced at $6998, and they docked it down until it was exactly $7000 after tax title and fees.The salespeople are nice, not to mention they have this cool thing in the finance offices where you sign electronically like, on the desk. Its really interesting. They helped me find a car that I truly believe will last me through college, and they seem to all have the same attitude as they did 8 years ago. They really know their stuff about their cars, and really care about getting you exactly what you need.I'm really happy I bought my car from there, because I get to recreate an old relationship my family had with the dealership. I know if there is EVER a problem, Hendrick Honda will do everything they can to help me out.TL;DR: Hendrick Honda is amazing. If you are looking at getting a new or used car, I'd go check them out."

Hi all - Looking for a barber in Charlotte, as I'm moving there soon. I have a classic men's side-parted style (think Don Draper, as cliche as that is), but where I'm currently living now I haven't been able to find someone to do this well. Do any of you know anyone that is good? Thanks!

"I just purchased a new couch and thought I would see if anyone on Reddit would like my old one.  It is a few years old, but has barely been used (it was an extra piece of furniture for my attic before moving here to Charlotte).My new couch is coming this Thursday (3/3) so I would need someone to pick it up before then.  The couch is in great condition, with the only real flaw being the plastic under the fabric on one of the arm rests has a dent in it.  It's not very noticeable while looking at the couch, but you can feel it with your arm resting on the left side armrest.Either way, I know it's not the best of deals, so that's why I am not asking for any money for it.  Just someone willing to come and pick it up.  The couch has done me good, and I think it still has a use versus just being thrown away.  Hoping it could work out for someone who has some space that they would like to fill.  Here's the pictures.  Let me know about any specific questions.  The pillows come with the couch.  They're pretty nice pillows.  I liked them enough to try and keep them, but I was told my taste is bad and that they wouldn't look good with the new couch.http://imgur.com/a/OKYW0 "

Thanks!"
Does anybody know which one this is? Me and my wife's anniversary is coming up and I want to book it up and surprise her.

Just like the title says. I have a washer and dryer that I need to get rid of today. It's free if you can come pick it up from my place in noda.
"Looking to start lifting again. It's always more fun with a partner, especially if we're doing the same program.I live smack between the Harris and Ballantyne YMCA, so I was thinking about getting a YMCA membership so that I have the location flexibility. If you're already a member somewhere, it makes no difference to me.For program, I was planning to do [Phrak's Greyskull LP](http://i.imgur.com/4zQdb.jpg) but I'm open to Stronglifts 5x5 as well, or even Starting Strength if you can teach me how to do cleans.I'm obviously very much a novice lifter, but I know enough about form to not hurt myself. If you're completely new, that's fine with me, I'm basically starting over in terms of numbers. And I don't care what shape you're in, either.For schedule, I was planning M/W/F after 5:00 PM, but I can adjust. T/Th is generally not good for me though.May matter, may not, but I'm a dude. I don't much care if you're female - there won't be any ego or weirdness issues.So, yeah. Let's get swole."
Has anyone been and if so how was it? I am heading to Charlotte for the Gold Rush Rally and Street Car Takeover from out of town. Looks like something fun to do while in the area.
"Hello, My wife and I were thinking of hiking at King's mountain (16 mile loop).  I heard it was necessary to obtain a permit from the ranger station there before setting off on a hike? Has anyone done the hike before and if so did you need a permit? Thanks in advance. "

I'm currently at the bar but will grab a table as it gets closer to 6.**"
Hi guys, prom is coming up and I need a tux. A nice fit is a priority for me. I'm paying for the rental myself so cost is a factor, but I would pay a bit more for a nicer tux/better fit. I live in fort mill so anywhere in the general fort mill/uptown area is fine, but I'm not sure I would want to drive up to Concord for a tux. Where's the best place to rent a tux?
Hey Charlotte! I want to become more involved with the food scene here beyond eating out at restaurants, and was hoping you guys would have some suggestions! Things like wine clubs, social dinners, anything food related at all really (I just signed up for Dinner Lab Charlotte, so I'm looking forward to events by them). I appreciate everyone's help and I can't wait to see what all is here! 
I visited yesterday evening...8 hours later i wake up in the worst stomach pain of my life and i'm vomiting fun things including blood. Don't be an idiot like me and believe the CDC's report that the outbreak is over. Many ragrets :(
Hoping to catch a game with a buddy and funds are tight. I know stubhub has some but their fees are ridiculous and thought I might see if any of you /r/Charlotte people had any you weren't using 
I recently got into soccer and went with Leicester City as my team because of the relationship they formed with the panthers and now I'm hooked. I was curious as to whether there was anywhere to watch their matches around Charlotte.





Heard about 4 gunshots and a car peel out just now at 1:50am. I live on the corner of Fairview and Park. Anyone else hear that?

Anyone know where to find exceptionally tall bar stools around town?  Bar measures 48 inches high and it looks like we need to get something at about 36 inches.  Normally barstools seem to be 24-28 ... more info here: http://www.hayneedle.com/bar-stool-buying-guide.cfm

"I know this is super vague, but I'm an outsider and I'll be in Charlotte in May and want to take my friends to this awesome bar I once visited 2 years ago, but for the life of me, I can't remember the name or location of it.I do remember the area seemed like a mall, 2 stories, outdoor (or just no roof), and it had a couple bars and restaurants sprinkled inside. I believe it was basically right in the heart of the city. The bar I mentioned was on the second story as well.That's really all I can remember about it, so I apologize again for the vagueness, but if someone could please give me the name or location of the area, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'll be in town with some friends for Carolina Rebellion."

"Curious if anyone on here has been involved with the organized sport groups through SportsLink?http://www.sportslinkus.com/sports/ultimate/I'm a recent Charlotte relocate, and I came across their website today.  Moving from a smaller area, I did not have access to large, organized sport meetups like this.  I am very interested in the Ultimate league, and registered to get more information from the site.  I just wanted to see if anyone from r/Charlotte had any feedback good or bad about the groups.I guess they have an open game on Saturdays from 11-2 in Noda, so I'm definitely looking to check that out.  If anyone has any recommendations for other leagues/groups, please let me know!  I live in South End and have weeknight and weekend availability to travel wherever needed."

Anybody know how much it cost to get your drivers record at the DMV? I checked the site and couldn't find anything.

I'm still in the interview process but things are moving quickly so I'd like to be somewhat educated about the area. The new job is in Charlotte, I don't have the exact location yet. My wife and toddler son, and dog, would be in tow and I'm looking for a nice quiet location with commutes 30 mins or less. I'm more of a rural surroundings person, I'm comfortable with being 15-20 mins away from a grocery store. Price range for a home is 200-250k. I'd love to hear advice!"
I live in Greenville SC, but am usually in Charlotte two nights a week for work. The hotels have never been this busy or filled in a while. Just wondering what was happening.



Has anyone tried this milk ? Where can I get it and what is the price .

Hey everyone. I'm from Hickory and I'm commuting to Salisbury for work. I'm thinking of moving to Concord so I can commute to Salisbury for work and then still have the luxury of being close to the city. Has anyone had any experience with Bexley Village in Concord Mills? They look really nice, and it's right beside 85, but the fact that it's right beside the mall and the same exit as the track worries me about the traffic, especially after work rush hour. I can handle the holiday/weekend madness, but I'm more concerned about leaving for work in the morning and getting back. If there are any other apartments that I should consider, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm also thinking of Integra Springs in Kannapolis. 
We're looking to add to our family now that we finally have a house. Any one know of any upcoming dog adoption events in the south Charlotte area? I'm aware of some of the major rescues and shelters, but haven't seen any advertisements for events in the near future lately. 




I have a judgement against a former roommate and would like to sell it to a debt-collection agency.  I understand that I'm going to be selling it at a substantial discount, however I am unlikely to get anything at all for it otherwise (simply because I don't have the time/skills to chase the person) so this still interests me.  Alternatively, are there agencies that work on commission?  Has anyone used an agency for someone in the Charlotte area.  Any recommendations?

"Charlotte Agenda Live hosted 400 people tonight to hear Tom Hanchett from the Levine Museum of the New South talk about Charlotte's history of segregation.It was far from a stuffy academic lecture. Tom tailored the talk to Charlotte residents who want to learn about their growing city and do something about it. There were constant questions from the audience, including the unanswered, ""So what do we do about it?""To recap a few of the history lessons:* 1875 - Charlotte was reasonably, surprisingly integrated* 1890 - Depression, increased fear. Voting laws were passed which included poll taxes and/or literacy tests. While this affected all poor and uneducated, it particularly disenfranchised black citizens. Outcomes included the plummeting of funding for black schools and ordinances requiring minimum home costs in some areas.* 1930's onward - Mortgage discrimination. Even federal mortgage guidelines explicitly rank desirability of ethnic groups. Black citizens and black neighborhoods can't get mortgages.* 1960's - Charlotte known for doing relatively well at desegregation at the time.(I don't recall if he outlined historical causes for increases in segregation after the civil rights era)Jan 2016 Charlotte Agenda post introducing the event:https://www.charlotteagenda.com/34967/charlotte-agenda-live-speaker-series-events/Today's Charlotte Agenda post from Tom:https://www.charlotteagenda.com/39217/tom-hanchett-city-of-strangers/---Anyone that went, please chime in with what you thought or other points that I missed."

"Hi Guys.  I'm in the process of buying a house in the Mint Hill / Matthews area.  A HUGE part of the reason we wanted this house was because it funneled into a good school system.

Honestly, 95% of the reason we're buying this house is because of the schools.  I'd hate to get locked into this home and then they change the school district on us later.Thanks!!"

"So I just got a violation note from my HOA citing my political sign.  I checked the covenant before I put it up and didn't see anything that would prohibit it.  The article they cited is... well.. pathetic.  It states:*""Nuisance.  No noxious or offensive activity shall be carried in or upon any Lot in the Common area nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become an unreasonable annoyance, inconvenience or nuisance to the residents of the Project or unreasonable interference with the quiet enjoyment of occupants of Lots.  No owner shall permit anything to be done or kept on his Lot which would result on the cancellation of insurance on any residence or any part of the Common Area or which would be in violation of any law.""*I think that's a friggin stretch.  Does anyone have any experience fighting HOA's on petty stuff like this?  I'm relatively new to HOA life.edit:  I want to thank everyone for their comments.  I sent a polite email to the HOA group and I have taken down the sign until I hear a response, or until a few days pass... whichever comes first.  Then it shall make a triumphant return.edit 2:  Received a quick reply to my email.  The company is going to forward to the Board.

Would anyone that knows Charlotte well consider the part of South Tryon that meets 485 a sketchy area? Specifically from 485 on towards W Tyvola.  Thought I made a good decision on a new place to live but was told otherwise and just wanted some other opinions.  Thanks in advance!
Ive looked everywhere. Much help would be incredibly appreciated.
"**When:** Most Tuesday nights, from 5:30 until 9:30. Next session is tomorrow, the 16th.**Where:** [Parker, Banner, Kent, & Wayne](http://pbkwcomics.com/) over in Cornelius, NC. It's behind a Rite-Aid. If you have trouble finding it, I'll try to provide extra directions. I may also be able to provide transportation depending on your own location.**What you need:** Honestly, just a character sheet and a pencil, and even those I can provide if needed. Optional goodies are the player's handbook for convenience, and your own set of dice (though I have a few that can be used. All you really need is a good attitude and a love for roleplaying games.**Character Creation:** You're allowed to use any class or race option made available by Wizards of the Coast, including their Unearthed Arcana resources. This is fifth edition. If you're new, then I and the other players can help you out with character creation when you show up. If you'd like to make the character ahead of time, we're using standard array/27 point buy. DO NOT roll the character's stats.**Current Party:** I won't go into detail about their stories as that's up to the players themselves how much they divulge and when. The current make up is a Human Ranger who dual wields swords, a Halfling Arcane Trickster Rogue, and a Half-Elf Wild Magic Sorcerer. There is also a Half-Elf Bard, though she is unfortunately an infrequent player at the moment and occupies essentially a guest spot. I'd prefer new players not have classes already being used, but as long as there's enough difference between them, it's not a major issue.**Setting:** Details [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3l8kl7/the_world_for_my_dd_campaign_setting_sabah_a_land/) if you're interested in the read. Long story short, the story takes place post-apocalyptic magical war. It's a homebrew setting, so you don't need to know anything about the other D&D worlds. We're making plenty up as we go, so if there's an aspect you're interested in that hasn't been explored yet, you can bring it up so it can be incorporated into the campaign.That's about it. If there's any questions, then please let me know. The group is incredibly easy going and laid back. Every single person in the group so far has been completely new to either D&D or this particular edition, so we're all very newbie friendly. I can run at most about 7 players, and currently only have 3 (possibly 4) regulars. Not being able to show up for a session isn't a big deal and your character will quickly be caught up with the rest of the party."
Hey everyone! Late post this week again, sorry about that! This week we'll be heading to [Birdsong Brewing](http://birdsongbrewing.com/web/) for our meetup. Most people who have heard of Birdsong know it for it's Jalapeno Pale Ale, however they have a great selection and I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've tried from them. The food truck they will be having this week is Soca Eatery, who I have not personally tried, though their [menu](http://socaeatery.com/menu/) looks pretty damn tasty!

The few friends i have now are pretty busy with their lives, or married now, and I don't really know any people.Most of my interests leave me at home, but i do like going out, and doing other things like hiking, visiting uptown, running and working out, etc. My issue is mainly i can be social, but i just don't have any ways to get started, and going out alone just isn't nearly as interesting as having a friend to go with. Because of this i tend to enjoy myself at home, playing guitar, writing, an occasional game, netflix etc. I would LIKE to be more active, with people, it's getting started that i find hard i guess.The same issue, applies to meeting possible partners as well.I'm down for any suggestions and help, just looking for anything that might give me an in i guess.

Ya know how sometimes a good deed can come back to bite you in the ass.A few years ago, I convinced my elderly mother, who lives in the middle of nowhere and doesn't have cell signal, but does have satellite high speed internet, to drop her landline phone and I gave her my old Galaxy and put her on our family plan.  It's her only phone, and she uses the WiFi calling that is available on those models ( not all phones have that feature).  Of course, just a few more months until I can get my hands on the Samsung 7 and hand off my S5 to her, the S3 dies on her and its not working at all.  I can't leave my 74 year old mother who lives by herself without a phone, and I'm not really that keen on spending hundreds of dollars on a phone that has this very specific WiFi Calling feature, but that she pretty much uses like a Jitterbug!!!!Is there anyone out there who might have one of these hidden in a drawer somewhere that would be willing to sell it for under $75?I really don't trust Craigslist, and really only need something for a few months.Thanks so much"

The company told me that they go to houses to sell fiber optics to AT&T customers. I applied for public relations and it the position seemed like a sales job to me. Second, the office is in a odd location. It's off Tyvola Road, and it seems like they share their office with Oak Tree Marketing (I think that's the name). Not even a fancy office at that. Lastly, the guy who interviewed me did the pitch so well, it almost hooked me in. However, it felt like something Red Ventures would do. I interviewed with Red Ventures, but I also did my research on the company. My friend has worked there and hated it. If this company feels like Red Ventures, I don't think it seems legit.I'm just asking for those who have interviewed with or even tried working at Top Notch Consultants, Red Ventures, or similar companies like these if it's worth it.

It didn't come with a lot of documentation, so I'd like to have a mechanic look at it to make sure that nothing major needs to be replaced/repaired.Does anyone have a good diesel mechanic in the Charlotte area that they could recommend?  I would prefer a diesel-specific shop if at all possible.Thanks!"

"I am hoping to gather the hivemind of /r/charlotte to come up with some ideas that may work for what I am in search of.  Some of you may know already, but I am part of an Amateur Radio / Ham Radio club.  (Don't know what that is?  Swing by /r/amateurradio and see what's up!)  We are a 501(c)3 / non-profit, if that happens to sway any decisions.  Anyways - - every year there is a nation-wide activity called ""[Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)"".  As the ARRL's website states, ""Field Day is part educational event, part operating event, part public relations event"".  Well, we got the operating part covered.  We know we'll have our radios and antenna towers, wire antennas, generators, etc., and we'll be on the air no matter where we wind up.  But where we're struggling the past few years is that public relations / educational portion - mainly due to location & audience.  Past years we have held field day at [Belk Scout Camp](https://www.mycampgrimes.org/directions_belk.phtml) (for a few years, I believe), we've done at at the [Park on Wilgrove](http://www.minthill.com/parks_recreation.php?Parks-Recreation-Park-on-Wilgrove-9) in Mint Hill, and most recently last year in Downtown Matthews (the field right across from Carolina Beer Temple).  Downsides to the scout camp - no outsiders at all came by.  There were some scouts there, but they paid us no attention either.  Downside to the park on Wilgrove - very few people go to that park it seems... Downside to Matthews - very few people came by (however, *I* blame this on the terrible weather we had that weekend, but no one else in the club wants to believe that was why).  So, what I am in search of is somewhere that has public visibility that isn't in an RF hole (essentially, not super below the average terrain around it), and isn't a Mecklenburg County Park (they require an off duty cop to be there the entire time or something ... wayyyy too much money).  We'd prefer to have running water / bathrooms, but portajohns are not out of the question.  We typically begin setup either mid-day on Friday, June 24, and leave that night (we usually have someone spend the night in their car/nearby keeping watch on things), then on Saturday morning we finish setup and begin operation around 1:00p and run 24 hours.  Any ideas on where to begin looking / contact for possible locations?"

"Hi all,I am the tenant and my property management/landlord is trying to charge me for something I believe I should not be responsible for, in fact I think I need to take action due to an uninhabitable living conditions, but I am fairly new to Charlotte and have never had to get any lawyer for anything in my life so I could use some help.Free consultations a plus!EDIT: Folks asking me about the specific issue, see belowI moved into a house in Charlotte NC in September. The Property Management Company I was initially dealing with informed me that the house I was moving into was a recent Foreclosure purchased by the current landlord. There where a few issues upon moving in, but all in all for a Foreclosure was in pretty good shape. We noticed on the first day that out of our 2 toilets, 1 did not flush and the other barely flushed but shook violently. I also noticed a light on in the front yard (which, I did not know at the time, but it was the septic alarm) I have email correspondence the day after I moved in informing the Property Management of this. They sent someone to fix (not sure what he did) but the light went away and the toilets started to flush Yay! Since that time however, whenever it rains AT ALL, the septic alarm goes off, both the light and a loud buzzing noise. I mentioned it to the Property management again but noone was ever sent....eventually after days of no rain it usually cuts off. A few months after moving in our old Property Management was bought out by a different company. Even with them though, we have opened tickets about the issue, in fact between emails, texts, and maintenance tickets it is something we have brought up every month since moving in.Well lo and be hold, this weekend the light is on and no toilets are flushing. We get up with the Property Management and they FINALLY send someone to look at it again. The plumber says the pump is shot and not to use any water, so it wont back up into house. He gives the property Managment a quote of a couple thousand bucks and leaves. I get up with property management and they basically tell me to Go get a hotel for the weekend, because the landlord does not want to pay for it until he gets a second quote. I tell property management that I cannot afford a hotel upfront (they offered to reimburse). After one day in the house with no water I call them back. Keep in mind I have a 6 month pregnant wife who uses the bathroom alot, and an autistic daughter who is calmed by bathtime. When I call back I am told I am SOL and it may be days before someone can get out there, again they tell me to get a hotel, and again...I cant afford it as they gave me a limit of $85 dollars a night....on a weekend in Charlotte NC which is basically impossible. After hours of going back and forth they tell me that THEY will provide the hotel cost up front, it sucks because I have a house full of food I cant use and a ton of dirty clothes I cant wash....but showers and toilets are important so sure, the hotel deal sounds great. Checkedout of hotel this morning and came home right as the septic tank folks showed up. They were there to drain the tank, before the plumber came back to do what he had to do. Upon inspection the gentlemen tells me....nothing is broken it was just jammed up, apparently from wipes (I did not flush these) so he cleans it and viola....everything is great again. So I am thinking awesome, this is a much cheaper fix than the landlord was expecting so I guess he will be happy.I got to work a few minutes ago and they are CHARGING ME! They are saying it is tenant negligence and are trying to charge me for the Hotel stay, and the septic work. What in the world can I do, I couldnt even afford the hotel, much less this big ass bill. We are all caught up on rent, and never late.P.S. As a Side note last weekend during the snow, out heat broke. Once the vendor got to the house he was unable to fix the issue because he needed approval from a landlord....approval that he wouldnt get until 2 days later."

"Hi Charlotte gun enthusiasts! I wanted to see if anyone had any insight on the new process around getting a PPP. I have read that the time to fill is now upwards of 2+ months due to the new mental health check requirements. A year ago (Feb '15) I got my three PPPs in 5 days. Hearing this increase is scaring me.I'm asking because I JUST bought a G42 and didn't have my purchase permit on me (thought my 3rd PPP from when I ordered them in 2015 was at home) so I couldn't do paperwork. I paid for the gun because it was a lightly used, fully cercoated, G42 with all the extras I wanted including TTI mag extenders and night sights and for the deal I got, I wasn't missing out. When I went home to get my last PPP I had left, I couldn't find it. I will still dig around and try to find my last permit, but it seems its gone. So now I could possibly be waiting for 2+ months to pick up a gun I've already paid for.EDIT: I found my last PPP last night after ripping through every important document I have. I picked up my G42 from Matt at The Arms Room (down South Blvd about 5-6mi from Uptown) this afternoon; now it's just waiting to be shot!

My fiancÃ© and I are looking for something different for our wedding this summer, we are kinda broke but wanted something a little different, but didn't want to spend a ton of money. Would prefer to stay away to larger chains, we are open to pawn shops and things like that. Any suggestions?
Dissenting opinions not welcome.

I'm working on an entertainment project that will potentially have people visiting from Charlotte (among other places) and I need to replicate a building from there.  It needs to be a historic building, ideally one to three stories tall.  I can't use skyscrapers or modern buildings.  Can any of you folks help me out?

"So I parked in long term parking 2 at CLT today and upon arriving in NYC I can't find my keys which had a lanyard on it with my only pair of home and car keys. I've called everywhere to no avail. I have the exact latitude and longitude of my car I was just wondering if someone could peer into my car and see if they see the keys. I'll definitely reward someone if they find them. I'm freaking out because my flight gets in Monday and I have to take a licensing test for my job that I can't miss so I really need to find my keys. know it's a complete shot in the dark but help is appreciated"
This really pisses me off. Charlotte does the right thing, gets fucked over by Raleigh in invalidating it and having to take a forcible enema of bigotry, now we're going to get fucked over even more by the NBA and other businesses pulling out of Charlotte. Anyone else understand my frustration? Charlotte does the right thing and now that decision is going to indirectly lead to use losing the ASG.



"Well, needless to say I enjoy hiking the trails and mountains in my time off from work and just was curious if there are any small groups out there that do much hiking in WNC?  I usually travel to the Smokies a couple times a month to knock out some trails and was just trying to meet some other like souls.  Trying to do any trails from 2-8 miles one way with at some decent incline, sunrise an d/or sunset is a double bonus. (hoping to do a 14er  in a year or two).e: I guess I should add in here I do not look like your typical hiker and usually travel a bit slower, there is more of me!"
"Hey! I'm moving up to DC from the Deep South, and I'm stopping in Charlotte for a night. I'll get in a little before sunset and leave the next morning.All I'll probably do is grab dinner, maybe a cocktail after and walk around the city. Is there any ""walking part"" that might be worth staying in (hotel recommendations would be appreciated too). Also, where would you eat/have a drink. Mid-level price range. Thanks, y'all!"
"Hi!I have recently launched my own small business doing Product Design / Development.  I am also employed full time as a product designer for a major corporation but I am hoping to grow this into a full time gig.  We specialized in CAD Design and Drawings for a wide variety of applications.Check out the website and let me know if you see anything that could be improved:Rapid3Designs.comWhat exactly would you be looking for if you were in need of design services?Also, if you have any work you need done I would be happy to offer a ""Reddit"" discount!"
"I'm starting to hear from constituents who say, ""But Jeff, I didn't like the Charlotte ordinance! Why should I care what just happened in Raleigh?""Because you just got played, that's why.The ordinance was used as political cover to pass a sweeping bill that was written in secret, unveiled at the last minute, rammed through in 12 hours, does all kinds of things that have nothing to do with the ordinance, has likely jeopardized our state's business recruitment, and has generally embarrassed us nationally.And here's my point: It was all because a few politicians saw this as a golden opportunity.The truth is, folks in Raleigh could not care less about the ordinance.The person who ran the bill in the Senate is a Republican running for Attorney General. His colleagues always let him give the first speech about the bill and you'll never guess who he blames for all this: the current Attorney General! You know, the same guy who *literally* had nothing to do with any of this.For good measure, the state Republican party released an attack ad against the current Attorney General on this issue yesterday morning, just as the special session got started. What a coincidence.Our Republican Governor - the one who originally refused to call a special session because he said he didn't want a broad bill that dealt with matters beyond the ordinance - signed the bill anyway, just before midnight. His political incentive for caving? His veto would have been overridden and his legislative agenda would have been blocked as punishment for even trying to stand firm. And even though he doesn't like this bill, he'll still campaign on it. Watch.The Republican leadership in the state House and Senate is terrified of a Donald Trump nomination. They think this is a great issue to protect their gerrymandered seats, so they're going to use this issue to run absolutely vicious ads - the type we've really never seen before in North Carolina - this fall. So get ready for that.Bottom-line: Even if you strongly opposed the ordinance, please know that this bill wound up having almost nothing to do with it. These guys grabbed your banner and marched right off a cliff, on your behalf.EDIT:Getting some fair questions about what was added onto the bill in addition to the bathroom piece.  I should have included that in my original post - my fault.1. The bill repealed every non-discrimination ordinance in the state, including those that prohibit shops and restaurants from discriminating against people based on race, gender, or religion.  It nominally replaced these ordinances with a statewide version, but there's no enforcement mechanism (worst case scenario = non-binding mediation, as compared to Charlotte's worst case scenario, which was an injunction).  So the bill effectively removed any legal penalty for denying service to African Americans or women.  The bill also nixes a bunch of other local ordinances that have nothing to do with discrimination, like anything to do with employment or wages.2. Related to the above point, it eliminated the ""private right of action,"" (i.e., the ability to sue) for being fired because of your race, gender, or religion.  You can sue in federal court, but no longer in state court.  I believe it's now just us and Mississippi in that boat.3. In requiring students to use bathrooms that align with their anatomical gender (something the Charlotte ordinance, which did not apply to schools or churches, didn't touch), the bill jeopardizes billions in federal money NC receives through Title 9.  Tennessee tossed out this same idea earlier this week out of this concern."
I need a good attorney to help me settle my Mom's estate. Possible complication: Union County. I have an attorney now, but things are progressing very slowly. I believe the problem is that his office is in Mecklenburg County, and the time and trouble it takes to get down to the courthouse in Monroe is a burden for him. If you know of someone decent in Monroe or western Union County, I'd sure appreciate it.

Regarding the tirade Tuesday post I was making, I was totally serious with what I said about the gender bathrooms issue. I said some things I shouldn't have said and sounded like a complete judgemental  asshole while doing so. I didn't even read into the bill going through the GA which affects a lot more than just gender oriented bathrooms, and made ill thought out statements. After some deep thought, I can see how there are many benefits to having gender neutral bathrooms. I am sorry if I have offended anybody, especially the Trans community, and /u/Kittycat-banana.

Looking for someone to skate with in charlotte!

I know there have been many requests for people looking for thrift stores. I am writing in looking for more suggestions for thrift stores that I may not have yet discovered in or around Charlotte that would be good places to find clothes that fit in with the American Prep look (Oxfords, khakis, polos, ect). I have had some good luck at the Salvation Army on Pineville-Matthews Road (Lacoste, Jcrew, Ralph Lauren type brands). I was wondering if anyone had ideas for other spots I could try. Thanks for reading and any ideas you can throw out. 
"The [observer has a post up on the subject](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/development/article67607242.html)  > Charlotte City Council members disagreed Monday night on how they should approach the question of including affordable housing units in new apartment buildings, with some musing about a more muscular approach and others saying a rezoning meeting isnâ€™t the right forum for such a discussion.The issue comes down to should Charlotte look to have **mandatory inclusionary zoning** which would force developers to include low income units in new projects.  Personal Take:  This is not something Charlotte should do.  The aspect of **mandatory** puts too much power into the hands of bureaucrats and takes it away from developers...who are taking the risk on the project.  Even if that risk comes with great profits.  That said, Charlotte needs to move forward to solve the housing issue for low and medium income residents.  I think a good solution would be for Charlotte leaders to take on the issue with a wide net and look at both private development zoning, transportation and public projects such as green space and housing as a single fork rather than individual swords.  Identify several locations around the city where the City of Charlotte holds the title to land and where transportation can be improved.  In these areas, work with developers to redevelop those parcels while at the same time improving access to the job centers through public transportation.  In other words, don't mandate income levels in some projects because you have the ability to deny a zoning request.  Rather, create opportunities for different projects to become profitable and beneficial to the community you want to support.  What say you?"

My GF and I would like to day drink as we both have had a long couple weeks. What are some good brunch spots in Charlotte with the emphasis on drinking. She is a big mimosa fan. It would be this Saturday. I love going to Selwyn's Pub for this type of thing but was wondering if anyone else had some ideas.
I set up a test drive for Friday and am curious what it was like for others who've tried.

I am about to be relocated to work in downtown. I have a fun idea that I think may beat the system. I know working uptown will run me about 100$ a month with a monthly pass.

I went on there previously (before contacting the DA) and the citation did show up. Also, this page on the [DMV website](https://edmv.ncdot.gov/VehicleRegistration/Account/LogOn?ReturnUrl=%2fVehicleRegistration) will not allow me to enter my license plate and title number, it gives me the error:> ""Service can not continue. Please contact DMV for more information.919-715-7000 (8-5 Mon - Fri)""Because my tags were expired for so long, I am having to pay again for new tags, because the ones the DMV gave me expired in February (and I got them mid-February), but I can't access the Registration page to enter. I'm afraid of getting yet another citation.My question is this, since my court date was scheduled to be soon, should I believe what the email and website are saying about the citation being removed? I tend to not trust the government to do things correctly, so I am a little paranoid about the whole thing not actually being taken care of."

So, I'm totally new to drift triking, but caught the fever after stumbling on a few videos, and seeing that it's actually pretty popular, and looks fun as hell!! I've been building/welding my own frame together, and I am nearing completion with my project, but because I have never actually done any sort of Xtreme style sport, short of skateboarding when I was way back in my teens, I don't know of any public areas/parks that are safe/tolerant of things like drift triking. I was at Reedy Creek Park yesterday, and noticed signs that just said "bikes on paved surfaces only", and I think a drift trike would be classified as a bike, soooo is it safe to assume that I'm within the rules if I stay in the boundaries of a public park? Does anyone have experience, or are there any groups that are in the QC or surrounding that could point me in any sort of direction? I want to have fun, but also make sure I'm not doing anything that's gonna ruffle feathers or be unsafe.
Any suggestions or recommendations? We are looking to rent a house in Ballantyne within the next week or two.

Obviously Charlotte doesn't have quite the haunted history as Charleston but I feel like this would be a fun idea. Does anyone know of anything similar in the area? If not I may look into people who would be interested in getting one going because I thought it was a really enjoyable time and Charlotte certainly has the walkable areas to do such a tour.

"Hi /r/CharlottePosting on a throwaway just in case. I work security for a couple of bars/clubs uptown, and I just wanted to let you guys know we've had a bunch of phones stolen, some of them right out of women's purses. Unfortunately, we can't catch everyone - it's dark, and there are a lot of people and things we're already looking out for.So here's what you can do if you plan to go out uptown(or anywhere, for that matter), especially this weekend with the pub crawl:1. Don't plug your phone up inside. You've had a few drinks, your phone battery is at 5%, I get it. You'll end up walking away and leaving it, and someone will take it, no matter how nice a place you're in. Let your phone die - that drunk text to your ex at 3 am isn't worth it anyway.2. Ladies, keep your purses slung on your shoulder in front of you, and keep them zipped/snapped up. If it's behind you, someone can take your phone out of your purse and you'll never know. 3. Don't give your purse/phone/whatever to a friend if you're going to go dance and they're not. They are not as worried about the security of your phone, I promise you that.4. If you see someone suspicious, maybe who isn't holding a drink, just standing around, or if you see someone glancing into women's purses behind them, point them out to the bouncers. **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CONFRONT SOMEONE.** Even if you are 1000000% sure you saw them take a phone or you think you caught them in the act, come talk to the security. If you confront them, you're just gonna get yourself thrown out. We will not go searching someone based on your word alone. 5. **SERIOUSLY, DO NOT CONFRONT ANYONE.** We are trying to catch them in the act so that we can hand them over to Charlotte's finest and they can go to jail. If you confront them, you'll just spook them off and they'll go somewhere else, or just wait a while to try again. And as soon as that happens, we're gonna have to ask you to leave for causing a scene.We security guys are much nicer than you think. We are there to make sure you're safe, even from your overly-drunk self, and to make sure everyone's having a great time. Come talk to us if you see an issue like this or any other kind. Have fun and be safe this weekend! Oh, and feel free to tip..."

Maybe it's just because I've been looking, so I'm more aware. But in addition to the spray of AK-47 rounds last weekend during the CIAA there was a shooting IN BROAD DAYLIGHT Friday in uptown. Since that was right outside my building I googled to find out more and ended up reading about several other shootings in the past couple days all in or near uptown, including 2 shot in the head, a man with "life threatening injuries" found shot in his car near Memorial Stadium, and a body found in a car on 485. Seems like a HUGE spike.
Hey everybody, got a bit of a mystery today. I ran up on two guys riding what looked like Tomos brand mopeds into the Brawleys Beverages parking lot and I asked them where I could find one for myself (car long Gina and my other moped has conked out and I just want something economical) they told me I could get one at Old School Mopeds, just a it further south on Park Rd, but I can't find anything for it on maps or online. The closest physical location is apparently just past myrtle beach in SC, or I could order it online but I'm a little wary of that.... Does anyone know where this place is? And yes, I know about Charlotte Scooter Shop, I'm just a little wary of that place after a few disastrous repair attempts by the guys there.... Any info would help much, thanks!!
I'm trying to purchase some decent speakers for a turntable setup but craigslist is full of junk or sketchy people (no surprise there). Is there anywhere in Charlotte with high quality speakers that I could listen to before buying anything? (not best buy)

"Charlotte, North Carolina is slowly growing in popularity as more and more people decide to move to the area. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are single, part of a couple or moving as a family â€“ the area boasts of features that make it one of the best places to settle down. So what exactly can residents brag about Charlotte, NC? Here is a list:**Melting Pot**The best thing about Charlotte: the fact that no one who lives here is actually from Charlotte. The city is home to thousands of people who came from different parts of the country and even the world. The lack of a solid culture is actually a good thing because it turns into an excellent melting pot of any race and age. As a result, you will find yourself meeting all kinds of people, exposed to all kinds of food and essentially enjoying all kinds of activities and pleasure not limited to just a specific region.**Weather**The weather is perfect! All four seasons are experienced in Charlotte, but not in extensive levels. During summer, the weather is not incredibly hot and during winter, there is enough snow to enjoy the season without obliterating too much of the road. Spring and fall are, of course, equally present and actually beautiful considering how Charlotte is still home to lots of trees and plants. Whether you live in the actual city or a little farther from the center, you will be able to enjoy the changing colors of the leaves as the season changes from one to the next.**Traffic is Non-Existent**Traffic is an ever-increasing problem that seems to be existent in every major city. If you are tired with all the traffic, however, Charlotte will be able to give you the kind of drive that affords leisure and comfort. No need to worry about an hour-long drive just to get some groceries since the roads here are far from congested. In fact, depending on where you live, it is perfectly possible to just walk to places for supplies.**Jobs**Charlotte is a banking capital, but donâ€™t imagine it to be one of those strait-laced cities where everyone rushes from one place to other wearing suits. Beyond the banking center, the people of the city are pretty laid-backed and enjoy the kind of life quality in New York but without all the drawbacks. If you are thinking about moving to Charlotte, then you will be glad to know that there are lots of jobs to go around, ensuring that you will find a means of support when you finally move here.**The Beer**Charlotte boasts of home-brewed beers unlike anything else you will find in the country. Sure, popular bars carry all kinds of beer â€“ even the ones that you have gotten used to in your old watering hole. Additional brands are available, however, and if you will just try one of them, you will find that the home-grown drinks are better â€“ and taste more of Charlotte.**Active Outdoors**There are around 10 mountains nearby and tons of outdoor activities to keep you in shape. Hiking trails, mountain climbing, biking trails, and even chasing the white rapids are available in Charlotte. The Rapids are a favorite for many, especially since the US National Whitewater Center is located nearby. It offers a perfect simulation of whitewater rafting minus all the possible dangers and problems you will encounter in the actual scenery.**NASCAR**Not everyone is a fan of NASCAR but if you are, then you will be glad to know that Charlotte is NASCAR heaven. Also, if you are not content with just watching the race â€“ you can actually participate in it â€“ or at least, gain some experience. There are some services that let you enjoy a few laps for a fee.**Food, Glorious Food**The fact that Charlotte is a melting pot of so many culture means that you will be able to find all sorts of food in their restaurants. Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and more â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter what kind of food you prefer because you will find them all in Charlotte. There are also restaurants strictly for the vegetarians or vegans so the place welcomes practically anyone with varied dietary preferences.**Market and Relaxation**Residents of Charlotte always look forward to the first Friday of the month because this is when all kinds of food trucks come over for a city-wide fiesta. There are morning markets and farmer markets, both of which sell some of the freshest and most affordable food items that you canâ€™t get anywhere else. Of course, that doesnâ€™t mean the market is limited to those days. The fact is that they are open all year round, featuring a strip of stalls and cafes that serve all kinds of food for your pleasure. It is easy to eat healthy here as well as live healthy, especially with all the spas and services designed to help you relax.**Nightlife**For the singles out there thinking about moving to Charlotte, look forward to an excellent nightlife but without the usual danger that comes from living in the big city. Charlotte is host to some of the most active yet safe bars which can be packed every Friday and Saturday night. No worries if you are hoping to meet that special someone in Charlotte â€“ the city is home to lots of singles so you can definitely find some action here.**Family Facilities**Of course, those who are moving to the city together with their kids will be happy to know that Charlotte is incredibly welcoming to families. The real estate prices here are within reasonable range and the children will benefit from the near-quiet lifestyle of the neighborhood. There are also lots of schools for elementary and high school students, each one featuring an excellent education system. For college students, there is the University of North Carolina which is one of the most prestigious schools out there.**Pet Friendly**Another fact residents love is how Charlotte welcomes every member of your family â€“ even the four-legged kind. There are parks, bakeries, and even bars for dogs and tons of services meant to keep your family pet happy.I hope you enjoyed the article. Please consider us to help your next move go smoothly in Charlotte.[Hornet Moving](https://hornetmovingnc.com/)[Link to post](https://hornetmovingnc.com/blog/reasons-to-move-to-charlotte-nc)"

I was born and raised in Ohio and have lived in North Carolina for about 15 years.

Got an e-mail from our HOA President that said while it's not official just yet my neighborhood is likely to be rezoned. Our School Board Representative is Eric Davis.  I vehemently do not want our zoning to change since our elementary, middle and high schools are all very good and the schools we would be rezoned to are not good. A local RE agent said our homes values will likely decrease by 15-25% as a result. Anyone in this same situation and any advice on fighting this?  EDIT: This is all "educated speculation" at this point and we will not know for sure if we will actually be rezoned.

"So, long of the short, I just turned 28 years old.  I have lived in Charlotte for a few years working in finance.  Most of my friends I met in area were from work.  But, many of them have left the area now after leaving the job (and one of my closest friends has now gotten married and is now a little more focused on that part of his life).  I had a cousin in the Army I could go snowboarding with and hang out with on occasion too (he was stationed in Georgia).  But, he has now been relocated by the Army as well.Recently I havenâ€™t had much time to go out last year.  I have just been so busy with work and studying for a computer science degree on the side.  I guess I have just realized I really need to get out again with all my previous hangout friends gone.  I sort of lost track of time, being as busy as I was.So, at this point, I was seeing if there was any good place to meet people in there 20s (mainly to make friends)?  I don't particularly want to go anywhere loud like a club.  A bar that isn't super noisy would be fine though.  Also, I am going to start kayaking at the whitewater center soon.  So, I am up for doing various outdoors things.  Would really like to take up astronomy (but not sure anyone in there 20s or 30s is into that in the area).  I enjoy programming and recently took up chess for fun (maybe that boring to some, but I enjoy the topics haha).  If there was a local drone club, I would be up for joining that too.  Rock climbing or hiking would be awesome too.Overall, I guess I just feel alone in this city after losing a lot of my friends.  I would love to get out again and make more.  Does anyone have any ideas on making new friends in the area?  Thanks for any help.PS:  Also, I'm up for meeting up with people on here if any of the above peeks your interests :).

I just got my CNA I certification and am looking for a job. I've been having trouble getting on at Novant and CHS. I heard that you need to know someone at these jobs, but I don't. Maybe someone here can help! I'm a very compassionate person, I love helping people, and am a great team player. I don't have any prior job experience, but I did do clinicals in a nursing home and had a great time getting to know patients. I can provide references from my CNA instructor since she watched me work first hand.
Hi Guys.  In your opinion, what is the popular youth sport in Charlotte.  I used to live in New England and it was definitely baseball.  Then I moved down near NYC and it was soccer.

"After discussing the issue with a few friends of mine, I thought I'd look into powers of the Governor of North Carolina, specifically veto powers.  What I found made me rethink all the hate that Gov. McCory has been getting.  Apparently, each bill is read three times in each house and then sent to the governor for approval to become a law.  The governor does have the power to veto a bill.  If he does veto a bill, the bill goes back to the house from which it originated for reconsideration.  But then, the house can take a vote on it (yays and nays) and pass the bill into a law anyway if three-fifths of the members of the house present and voting, agree to pass the bill.  The HB2 bill passed the state House 82-26 and the state Senate 32-0 (with none of the Senate Democrats voting).  Even if McCory had vetoed this controversial bill, it would have passed anyway since the House and the Senate had more than three-fifths of the vote.  During his time as governor, McCory has vetoed bills before that became a law anyway.  Maybe he was pressured into signing this so that any bill he proposes is not completely shat on down the line in the houses or maybe he actually believes in this craptastic bill.  Either way, he alone does not deserve all the hate and blame.  Each and every representative of the House and the Senate equally deserve all the hate.  I kinda feel bad for the guy because he had no authority to begin with.  EDIT:  For everyone who still thinks there's nobody to blame but McCory, here's (http://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/25/1506355/-NC-HB2-Anti-LGBT-Bill-The-Roll-Call-Vote-And-Time-To-Shame-Some-Bad-Democrats) a list of people who voted to pass this bill.  People who YOU voted for.  People who are supposed to speak on YOUR behalf.  You want to point fingers that actually means something?  Find the person who represents you and ask them why they voted to pass this shitty bill.  You're barking up the wrong tree by hating on one guy."

All noisy.  It would just be fun to do something at night without that.Can someone maybe point to something good to do besides a bar or club?  Somewhere one could just go and sit and enjoy a good/not loud environment?  Like, a lounge type area.

"There is a [proposal for a private 'Olympic Training facility](http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/121460197-story) on the current campus of JM Robinson Middle School.  The details that are missing from this article are:* CMS gave a sweetheart 50 year lease to a private business owner, one of which with the last name *BELK* (yes, that Belk family) to build an exclusive 'Olympic Training Facility' in South Charlotte. * The facility will take existing school land and convert it to a private training facility for parents to have their kids trained for the Olympics..or better put make the local travel team.  * The facility will be closed to *ALL* CMS students except for partial use during the day on some of the facilities to JM Robinson students. * *ALL* JM Robinson faculty and staff will get a free membership to the facility however.   **So much for equality in the schools.**  Right?  You would think that if CMS were to lease school land that was purchased with tax dollars they would find a way to open the opportunity for all CMS students but that might hurt the bottom line for David Koerner and Ike Belk. Some may be asking why would an Olympic Training facility build out a facility in South Charlotte rather than near the other Olympic facility that the city invested so much money in.  Well the answer is pretty simple.  There is not enough wealthy parents out that way to shuttle their kids to that campus to chase the dream.  This location is the sweet spot for their bottom line.

I love to watch football, I am a Denver Broncos fan (from CO).  I am not a girly girl, I don't talk about hair and makeup or fashion.  my fashion is pretty limited.  I like to play board games as well.  I like all types of music: rap, rock, country, pop, dubstep, 90s, 00s.Just looking for another female like myself who may enjoy going to the dog park, joining a softball league, golfing, drinking red wine and watching a chick flick, etc."

My family and I will hopefully be making the move back to N.C. in the near future, but have chosen Charlotte over the eastern end of the state that we each lived in in the past.I am a life long fisherman but have never put a line in water in your area. I fish mainly from the shore with jerk baits, spinners, top water lures, and the occasional crank bait or Texas/Carolina rig in there too. I was wondering about the lakes, ponds, and rivers of the Charlotte area and what kind of access a shore fisherman might have? In my current area a lot of the ""lakes"" (really just large ponds) and ponds are 100% privately owned by those who own the properties around them, and are strictly enforced ""No Tresspassing"" areas. It leaves very limited areas of access unless you own a boat, which I unfortunately do not.Any help for a shoreline fisherman? Thanks!"

I'm a 24-year-old female.A couple months ago I had a huge change in my life when I left the fundamentalist religion that I was raised in. I have very few friends outside of that group and I lost all the friends I had within the group when I left. Being more of an introverted person, I'm a bit overwhelmed with going to bars or clubs to try to meet people. I'd also like to get to know friends on a deeper level. I've tried going to a couple of Meetups and yoga classes, but I haven't found that it's very easy to have a conversation or really meet someone in those situations.Does anyone have any suggestions of where I could go to meet new people and make friends in the area? I live near Plaza Midwood and NoDa.  And even though I grew up in a religious environment, I'm a very open-minded person. I'm open to trying new things and developing new interests. Most of my current hobbies are individual type things, which is part of why it's been hard for me to meet new people. I love to read, listen to music, watch Netflix, I'm learning guitar.

"I think PayPal pulled off a genius political stunt today in Charlotte. Here is why we call it a stunt... Paypal only agreed to come to Charlotte after holding out for Millions in corporate incentives ($3.7M to be exact plus $480,000 in community college incentives)Under McCrory's HB2 bill PayPal could have chosen to fill all 400 jobs with LGBT members if and provide bathroom and non-discrimination policies designed for their employees, company and shareholders but instead they forfeited the opportunity for political posturing.I think they missed the opportunity to make a difference and instead they look like hypocrites. Last month Paypal announced its expansion into Cuba, a country in which homosexuals and transgenders are imprisoned and tortured and currently do business in 26 counties where it is illegal to be gay and many of these countries kill the LGBT. Last week the state of Nebraska failed to pass a PayPal endorsed LGBT rights bill. Why is PayPal CEO Dan Schulman criticizing McCrory and keeping silent on the bill where his company hosts its Worldwide Operations Center? Should Nebraskan employees be packing their bags for California or Vermont?Paypal today sided with Chad Sevearance Turner, the Charlotte resident who was convicted for sexual assault of young boys, instead of the 69% of North Carolinians who support the safety and privacy of the women and children of Charlotte. It is beginning to look like Schulman was in the right spot to make McCrory look bad as a favor to Obama or the Human Rights CampaignI think Paypal is ridiculous, and they deserve to have millions of people who have common sense about women not sharing bathrooms with grown men boycott and cancel their Paypal accounts. I cancelled ours today and encourage you to do the same! See the map anaspiringengineer posted down below....."

"Wife and I (moving from chicago, as previously posted) have nixed NoDa, a house in plaza midwood, and a place in south park, and are now thinking pretty seriously that we'll do one of these luxury buildings for our first (only?) experience with Charlotte. We checked out a couple places while we were visiting this weekend, but we only found Silos on the internet when we got back home. Looks like they have a townhouse or two available, which fits my style a bit more (I'd prefer a house), but it's got the community feel and some amenities to keep my wife happy (we don't know anyone in Charlotte!). If anyone can tell me what the place is like, and specifically the townhouses if possible, that would be great! I'm reading mostly positive reviews online which is encouraging, but always a bit scary renting something sight unseen. Thanks so much, I look forward to  stopping harassing you all soon!"

Hey guys, my friend is getting married this weekend and we're doing his bachelor party later this week. What would you recommend as good, unique activities that can be done with a bunch of guys that doesn't require drinking? There can be alcohol of course at whatever venue it is, but the bachelor won't be drinking

I'd like to find a place to get in some practice with my rifles. I know they're are a lot of indoor ranges that allow rifles, but they're too small. Are there any large rifle ranges in the area, or if not a range safe areas where it'd be acceptable/legal to do some target practice?

"Hello,First of all, throwaway account. I'm 27 years old and going to school for my bachelors. I find myself to be at a weird place in my life where sometimes I feel that I don't fit in with the younger crowd and sometimes I don't feel like I fit in with the crowd my age (everybody's getting married/already started on there careers). I've lived in the area all of life, but I have somehow found myself without any friends (only acquaintances, perhaps one friend but she lives abroad). I don't know how it got to this point with me having only one friend who lives abroad and the rest aquaintences, but alas here I am. I want to change that. I suffer a little from social anxiety. But, I want to meet new people. When I go traveling, I love to stay in hostels and making new friends by going on pub crawls with everybody. My questions are:1. Is anybody familiar with the club scene in Charlotte (I prefer Latina girls, but any other race is fine too. I'm white)? If so, please say the scene (younger, older, type of music, layout, ext.).2. Are there any pub/club/bar crawls in Charlotte that happen on a weekly basis? Ones where I wouldn't feel awkward going alone?I'm open to any age range for the demographics whether it's the college scene or the older scene or somewhere in the middle. I'm not really sure if any demographic would be willing to except me (no career, still working on my bachelors) but I'm willing to try. I just want to make friends and would prefer to meet girls and see where it leads. If I don't put myself out there then nothing will change....... Also, I think I would feel uncomfortable going to a bar or club by myself  (even though I enjoy them from time to time), so if anybody knows of any pub crawls that are good for single people, please let me know!Any help is appreciated, thank you reddit Charlotte!"
"Out of towner here! Sadly, after an otherwise glorious day of stuffing my face with Amelie's macarons, I found a garishly bright orange parking ticket from Preferred Parking Service on my car. I thought it was a city of Charlotte parking space and on the ParkIt! website, it stated holiday parking was free. Anyway~ The ticket said I needed to pay $25. Sure, will do. The website said it was $50. Wtf. Apparently, I parked in a permit only parking spot. The additional $25 was parking without getting a parking pass. What's the likelihood I can appeal this? I'll pay the $25 since that was the citation I was given but the $50, I'm side-eying. Also, has anyone had a successful appeal from this company? "
The ones I have sampled have been pretty casual with music playing, banter, or whatever. I'm not a very serious yogi, but to me, yoga is mostly a practice of concentration and it requires earnest attention. Are any classes amenable to this philosophy?
"I recently moved to the Charlotte are from NYC and I would like to find some people to play D&D with locally. I've been to a few in-person games at Your Local Game Store, and they were fun, but I still haven't found the ""right"" group of people.I enjoy playing games with horror/mystery/fantasy/Lovecraftian themes, and would like to find people who have similar interests. I also am interested in playing a D20 modern 5th edition game which I have all the rules for and will share with anyone interested. I also have all the books and can share those as well."
It of course depends on what you're interested in, but are any especially good? Or especially bad?
"OK. I figured I wouldn't start a new thread for my questions. I have several though. Any help is appreciated!A little back story first. Myself, my wife, and my son ( ages 33, 35, and 6) are planning a move to Charlotte in March of 2017. I work for Sysco and would transfer with the company to their Concord facility. We currently live in Key West and are looking to get the heck out of here. We don't know much about Charlotte, but it's about an 8 hour drive to where we're from (Harrisburg, PA), and the cost of living is significantly lower than Key West.I want a decent school for my son in a neighborhood close to Concord. We're looking for a house to rent, not an apartment. What kind of taxes are regularly forked over each year? What about fees for cars? State payroll taxes? Car registration fees? Annual state vehicle inspections? Things like that. Pennsylvania taxed us to death and Florida is the opposite. Just trying to get my head wrapped around these things. Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long post.Bob"

Hello! Pay no attention to my username - after much consideration I have decided NOT to move to Denver and have chosen Charlotte instead! I'm looking to move in August 1st and was looking for opinions on neighborhoods where I can more easily find spacious apartments for less money than living right in Uptown. I've looked at neighborhoods like Dilworth, South End, NoDa and Myers Park and I love the hip/younger vibe of those neighborhoods. I'm looking for neighborhoods perhaps a little further out (within a 15-20 minute drive) that are safe and cozy yet close to the action. For example, I looked at a great place with VERY affordable rent in Gastonia. Is that a decent place to live? Would love some opinions on areas that are not right IN the thick of it but not the suburbs either. Can't wait!
"I've been to Lowe's and HD, and even a few plumbing supply stores, and it seems that I am limited to 4 inch sizing and lower that is typical in residential housing installations... I'm wanting to get a few feet (maybe upwards of ten total feet) of 10 inch, sch 40 PVC.I don't have to have ten feet really, and would even be interested in scrap pieces from construction sites, or if you have any just laying around from a previous job that you'd want to part width... I'd probably need at least 6 inches of width on any scrap piece, but the wider, the better because I can always cut it down.I'm making sleeves for my drift trike rear wheels, and want to have a good amount of replacements lying around for the few trikes I have."

"On our home stretch looking at rentals. Wife and I are comparing two places. Both small houses in our budget. One is in Plaza Midwood, a couple blocks north of central ave. The other is a block or so west of Park Rd near that shopping center (I think that's southpark right?). Both are nice but I prefer the southpark house in terms of size / space /general quality. But it seems like the Midwood one is nearer the action, almost walkable to bars and restaurants. Do people find southpark to be too far removed from things? Seems like it's a ten minute drive or so from South end, Dilworth (a couple places we found we enjoy), is that about right or does that change dramatically with traffic (we did the drive on Sunday of memorial day weekend)? We're early 30's, dog, no kids yet, each have a car."
"I work in IT and I'm meeting with a number of Charlotte area businesses to get some clients. Will be in the city for a month. Hotels are pretty pricey so I'm wondering if there are any alternatives? Where to find a sublet, or even a roommate? Are there any short-term rooms available, something like a Y or a rooming house?I just need to be able to get to the light rail to get through uptown.I have been to Charlotte before and loved it and may even wind up moving here full time.Any advice? Thanks."
"Let me start by saying I grew up in Randleman, NC. A little three stop light town in the middle of Randolph County. I volunteer at the Republican Headquarters weekly and volunteer for various Republican candidates. As such, I am proud to show my conservative roots in the form of a Trump hat and a GOP magnet on my car. Forgive me if this sounds like a stupid question, but would it be okay for me to wear my Trump hat and display my GOP magnet while I am in Charlotte for a few days? I like to proudly display both of them as long as it's not going to cause trouble. I rarely go to big cities and I usually don't consider this kind of thing. But I figured with the recent HB 2 stuff going on I would try and ask the people who live there first.  Edit: I think based on some of the comments I have seen, I am going to go without the Trump hat and possibly without the GOP magnet. I want to enjoy my time in Charlotte, and I am afraid that if I wear it I might be heckled. I don't want to let a few people ruin my entire trip. Thank y'all for the advice. :)"

"Like the title says, what are your opinions for or against motorcycles lane splitting/ lane sharing?  Lane splitting has been proven to help alleviate some congestion during heavy traffic times of the day.  It has also been shown to reduces motorcycle vs. automobile accidents during congestion and at traffic stops.  Lane splitting is riding between cars at a slow speed when traffic has come to a crawl, under 15mph, or traffic has come to a complete stop.  The general rule is that a bike should not exceed 10 mph while traveling between vehicles.Filtering is moving up between stopped vehicles at red lights. The issues I see arising are those of the motorcycling who will abuse the privilege and exceed safe speeds while filtering. Another issue I see is the air of intolerance from non motorcyclists, who will try to enforce the law of their own accord.As a motorcyclist myself, I feel that lane splitting should be legalized in North Carolina as a whole."
"I live in the Montclaire area and am looking for a carpet cleaning service. My wife is pushing for ZeroRez, which she heard of on the radio, but I can't find anything about it. Unfortunately, I only have a single room that needs to be cleaned, and the stairs leading down to it. The carpet was dirty when we moved in (renting from aunt and uncle), but I also know my pets soiled it at one point. I tried cleaning it up myself, and the odor went away, but I don't think I did a good enough job and just want to get someone else."

"Last year my son moved from Elementary to Middle School and we were encouraged by his teachers into getting him into Piedmont IB (which I find personally to be a Great School, not an issue with them all.) However he's struggled to just do the work, and at this point I'm afraid he won't pass, and will end up having to repeat 6th Grade at a different school which would have been his home school if he doesn't pass. If I get him into a summer school program, is there a way to make sure he progresses to 7th grade? He's definitely smart enough to do the work, his teachers keep telling me this, but his motivation, I just can't figure it out. Rewarding him, punishing him, talking with him, I can't seem to get through to him the importance of doing the work, and it's frustrating. He's been in therapy for some emotional issues (we all have, due to a death in the family, adhd) and even his therapist recognizes these things but is still having a hard time getting through to him.I'm not asking the internet to raise my kid here, just advice on where to look and who else to talk to about options. I can't be the only one who's struggled with this. "

"My family and I are going to Carowinds for the first time next weekend. My family used to always take trips to theme parks and its a big bonding experience for us. Unfortunately my mom had some medical issues a few years ago that caused her to gain weight. She's not like too big to walk or anything, but she does have huge boobs in addition to being overweight. We plan to ride every roller coaster, but after reading some of the restrictions I'm slightly concerned that she may not be able to get the harnesses down on certain rides. She's actively losing weight right now which is so great and I don't want this to set her back on her journey to higher self esteem. I don't want to get in a situation where she has to leave a ride while the rest of us have fun.I thought I'd ask here so I can deflect the family to other areas while we're there if needed. The ""guest assistance"" info isn't all that helpful and it looks as if there are only test seats in front of a couple of rides. Do you all have any recommendations for which rides we should definitely avoid? I'm a seamstress so I know her measurements and her waist is 2 inches over what Carowinds says is their max (their max is 52"" chest 40"" waist) Is there really any wiggle room with those measurements? Again, the guest assistance info isn't helpful at all here.Thank you all so much!"

"HiI am sharing as well seeking an advice here. Recently I've received this delinquency violation notice from charlotte airport.  This violation was of me parking at the no parking area 3.5 months ago.. so i received a delinquency notice on 5/19 and violation issue date was 2/5. Now,  I'm not sure why this ticket was issued at first place because i never left the car unattended and never parked car at the no parking area.  I was going with the flow of oncoming traffic and moving along, picked up my friend and left on the date 2/5. Now,  i received this delinquency notice, there is obviously no contact information on it.  But search online i called the number and their standard answer was to email at parkingtickets@cltairport.com. so i emailed them three times already to appeal or cancel this ticket because I've not violated any law.. also note that i can't appeal online since it passed 30 days of issue date. So the only option for me is to email them.  I again called that number provided on the website, she was pissed of for some reason and said they are backed up with lot of emails and she said wait for them to respond.  But i don't see any response til date.  Also i can tell that they have read the email 10 times already but haven't responded to me yet. Now,  having said that,  i don't want to pay because there is no violation. At the same time don't want to affect credit history because of this notice of this small amount.  Need your advice what can be done.."

Moving to Charlotte from Chicago, and looking at a few interesting rentals in Wilmore. I've done some internet research, and it looks like this neighborhood has a history of being a fairly high crime area that's undergone some gentrification. Is it considered a safe place to live these days? 
My son tried to pick up some items there that he and his gf purchased yesterday but they gave him a hard time and would not accept his temporary nc driver's license. (His renewed license is in the mail. I guess that's how the dmv works these days).  Anyway, they would not accept it and treated us like crap even though he had all of the paperwork.  His gf is cancelling the order which is probably a good thing since that store has fairly bad reviews online.   Based upon their poor customer service I would recommend that people avoid the place.

Anybody know of places just hiring for the weekend or for certain events? 

Howdy, folks. I love some disc golf (and camping). Are there any camp grounds in western NC that hold disc golf courses within the grounds? Or at a reasonable hiking distance?

"So, basically, the situation is this, my cousin and her boyfriend have recently moved to your country. But their work situation is a bit complicated (they're engineers in Venezuela, but since they just recently got their work permits, it's gonna take a while for them to actually be getting a job in their career), so they're doing what anyone would do and work what they can, as they have been doing in Miami for about a year or so.Now, they finally got tired of Miami people and its fucking heat, and they've tasked me with asking redditors of some states they've chosen as the closest and most viable. So, I'd like to know a few things about your city, like the usual weather, how are the people there, what's the latino population amount like, a lot, not many? Rent, taxes, crime rate, the transport system?

I live in the South Park area and since the weather is nice, I would like to take the almost 2 year old to some neat places around town or even further.  What are some cool places that would be good for a kiddo that young?  I've heard of the Lazy Five and we've taken her to the raptor center (she loves owls) and the splash park uptown.  I'd like to keep it under a 20 min car ride if possible.  I work too much like everyone else so I'm not sure what is around or what is best since I'm not friends with a ton of mommies or daddies in the area yet.  We like Freedom Park, the little nature museum there, etc.  so looking along those lines as we have found many places are really better suited for older kiddos like some of the playgrounds like Marion Diehl.  Thanks in advance for your help!!!

"My hot water heater (gas) is at least 15+ years old. I've never had any issues with it in the 7 years I've owned my house, but I know it has passed it's 6-8 year life span.    Knowing this, last year I enrolled in the warranty plan offered through HomeServe, at $10.50 a month. I've read through the terms & conditions of the plan and repairs and replacement are covered, up to $1000, no deductible, plus $400 towards costs associated with local code compliance.    I'm wary of home warranties as I've heard the contractors tend to put a band-aid on the issue, when the unit really should be replaced. Does anyone here have this coverage and have had to use it? Did you have any issues with your claim? I'm thinking about canceling the plan but given the age of my hot water heater, I'm nervous to do so."

With the consequent declaration by the minister or magistrate that the persons are husband and wife>>(2) In accordance with any mode of solemnization recognized by any religious denomination, or federally or State recognized Indian Nation or Tribe.Marriages solemnized before March 9, 1909, by ministers of the gospel licensed, but not ordained, are validated from their consummation.I'm hoping there are some other ""godless heathens"" on /r/Charlotte who might be able to offer advice.At this point we're strongly considering ""bring two strangers to the Courthouse and wait in line"" to get things done."

Hey r/charlotte!  I'm a member of Planet Fitness and usually go to the matthews/Sardis Rd. location.

"Hey friends, I just moved to Charlotte recently and have been checking out the local breweries and watering holes. I noticed a distinct lack of dark beers (porters, stouts, etc) so far. Most of the breweries seem focused entirely on IPAs, which really aren't my style. I realize it's ""out of season"" for dark beers, but considering all the beer chatter on this sub, I've been disappointed with the selection.I'm hoping you guys can point me in the right direction."
Hey there everyone! We're going to be switching things up a bit this week. Instead of a single brewery we're going to be testing the interest for the taphouses and beer gardens as here in Charlotte and possibly adding them to our rotation. This week we're heading to [Flight Beer Garden & Music Hall](http://flightclt.com/) which has come highly recommended which currently boasts (at my count) 64 different [beers on tap](http://flightclt.com/beer-list/) from 42 different breweries from around NC. This will be a great chance for anyone who has trouble finding a beer they enjoy to come out and take a look as there should be something for just about anyone!

A couple of friends and I are in the process of launching a Kickstarter and we are in need of a great video to make this thing successful. Our budget isn't too high (~$500) but we would be willing to part with some equity for a really amazing video. I don't have any of my own cameras but I do have a Phantom 3 Standard Drone that I could take shots that you direct as well. Please PM me if interested, Kickstarter experience is not required.

"My wife and our car is up in Penssylvania and will be for a couple of months.  One contingency we didn't plan for is our inspection is due.  She and the car won't be back in the state until the end of July, but the inspection and registration due by the end of july, which is cutting it too close for my comfort.The [NCDOT inspection FAQ](http://www.ncdot.gov/download/dmv/inspection_faq.pdf) states:***15. My vehicle is due for inspection, but I will be out of the state. What do I do?****A person who is out of state may obtain an emissions inspection in the jurisdiction where the vehicle is located in lieu of an inspection in North Carolina as long as it meets the requirements of  the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (40 C.F.R 51).*.So obviously she needs to find an inspection station in PA or a neighboring state (NJ, DE, MD) to perform the inspection per these standards.  But then what?  Do they fax it? Mail it?  How do they certify it so that NC will accept it, and how do we let NC know it's happened to we can complete the online registration?I'm hoping someone here has had to deal with this before to save me the potentially arduous task of navigating the NCDOT to figure this out."

"#Global Reddit Meetup Day is Saturday, June 25, 2016.I, myself, already have a commitment that day, so I will not be able to attend, but there was interest by many to have this at the USNWC (United States National Whitewater Center).  So that's what we'll plan on!If you have not been to the USNWC before, you are in for a treat!  The U.S. National Whitewater Center is a non-profit outdoor recreation and athletic training facility for whitewater rafting, kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking.  It is free to get in - you only need to pay a $5 parking fee.  I would recommend wearing sunscreen, and bringing some extra as well.  You can bring blankets / umbrellas as well, but keep in mind, as the day goes on, real estate to set these up becomes a premium!  No outside food or drinks are allowed, so keep that in mind (well, I am pretty sure no one looks down on you for bringing a water bottle).Pets ARE welcome here!  Just need to keep them on a leash.I am not sure what time you want to plan to meet up there, but there is ""River Jam"" at 7:00pm that evening:- Band: [The Floorboards](http://usnwc.org/the-floorboards/)- Time: 7:00 p.m. â€“ 10:00 p.m.- Date: Saturday, June 25th- Price: Free ($5 per vehicle parking fee)My recommendation would be to Meet Late Afternoon / Early Evening at a specific location, and plan to grab some food at one of the many spots at the USNWC, grab a cold drink (beer if you're legal), and set up to enjoy some great music and hang out with fellow redditors of /r/charlotte.If you take photos, please post them here!  We'll want to share them with the Reddit admins as well.For more information about the USNWC, visit [usnwc.org](http://usnwc.org/).For information about the GrMD, visit /r/GRMD or https://redd.it/4o8cr2&nbsp;#So, who's going to be there?!"
"Has anyone else experienced an annoying neighborhood moderator on the NextDoor app? There is one associated with my neighborhood who apparently doesn't work or do anything in her spare time because she is hyper-vigilant when it comes to removing what she perceives as ""discriminatory"" or ""inappropriate"" language.  As an example, someone posted about deer ruining their vegetable garden. Someone else commented & asked if it was the ""retarded"" deer seen throughout the neighborhood that always has it's tongue hanging out (I've actually seen this particular deer hanging out in my backyard, but I digress). Most of us know ""retarded"" isn't really a PC term anymore but I noticed she removed the guy's comment. She has removed one of mine before as well, and many others I'm sure.  I'm just curious if anyone else has strict moderators like this.

"Is the Charlotte USPS just maddeningly slow, or are other people missing stuff as well? In May I mailed my niece a birthday present, we were told it was shipped priority, but were never given tracking for it (this was at the MJ Mart in Fort Mill, SC which also has a post office inside). My husband was only given a debit card receipt for the purchase. Long story short, it never arrived, and they can't do any sort of search for the package without a tracking number. When my husband went back to see if they could retrieve the tracking number via the transaction number on his credit card, nope they can't help us. Frustrating, but nothing we can do. Learning from this, when I mailed a letter with my passport renewal stuff I put tracking on the letter. It was sent last Thursday and was supposed to arrive on Saturday, but the latest status I've seen is that it left Charlotte and in transit (it's only going to PA). At this point my gut tells me that someone might have checked it in as on the truck/plane, but swiped it. I read an article about missing mail/packages in Meyer's Park last April so now I'm even more stressed about it. The birthday present can be replaced, but my passport stuff is a different story as we are leaving the country in 3 months. "

"Hello. My wife and I are moving to Charlotte and we are considering the Lake Norman area, specifically near Birkdale Village. I will be working in Uptown and I like idea of taking the 77x.(I can handle the ride which I'm figuring to be 45 minutes to an hour) The problem is how to get to the NorthCross Park and Ride without using my car. This leaves me with 2 questions:Does the 77X stop at any other locations besides the ones shown on the schedule? There looks to be a stop on Sam Furr Rd 1/2 mile away from the NorthCross Park and Ride but it is not listed on the schedule which makes me wonder if there are any others.Does anyone have any suggestions on how to cover the 1 or 2 miles from where we may live to the NorthCross Park and Ride without using a car? From what I hear, most months of the year 1 mile is too far to walk in the Charlotte heat (true?). Is Uber reliable enough in the LKN area to be used every morning to catch a bus? Does anyone have any experience with the Village Rider? The idea that it will pick people up within 3/4 of a mile seems outlandish to me.Thanks everyone."

"[Rude Gym Post](http://imgur.com/pFYSa2k)Take the athletes that cant complete bootcamp because they aren't ready?  I am confused, is this a gym, is this a community event, is this free, *applause* to you for making people feel like shit.Free yoga, zumba or cornhole?  -Why even mention cornhole, not relevent.  Yoga can be very challenging and stretching is essential to CrossFit.   No flexibility means improper squats, low elbows, improper snatchs.I just don't understand the ego behind this.  How can you have a goal of making Charlotte ""fit"" if you look down upon people that are beginning their fitness journey.  I am seriously concerned that this is a place that represents our community.  I am even more concerned that I have friends who workout here.  I guess there is something to be said about shiny new things and shiny new facilities.If they wanted to make Charlotte a fit city the gyms would work together to provide amazing events for the people that live here."

A bit of background: I moved to Charlotte in January and still haven't found a local job. I'm fortunate enough to still be working remotely for my previous job, so I still have money coming in and can be a bit selective in looking for jobs. My education is in politics/women's studies, but I am currently working as an editor. I've been scouring Glassdoor/Indeed, the Carolinas Healthcare website, and several companies that are around, but it seems like everything is either entry level or senior level...is there really that big of a gap in Charlotte and mid-level jobs are scarce? If anyone has any insight on how to navigate this job market, it would be greatly appreciated.

"I have a used iPhone 6 64GB AT&T that needs a new wifi antenna which is like 19$ if you DIY and has minor scratches on the corners, other than that its perfect. Gazelle is saying like $195, has anyone used them in the past or had any experiences with them?"
I'm looking for a wig a la Tina Belcher for a party this weekend. I don't want to spend a whole lot on it. Anyone know a place?
Since the breweries started popping up a year or two ago I have made it a point to try all of them in the area. Noda's North End location is great and for my money has the best individual draft (Hop Drop 'N Roll), Sycamore has a great scene in general, Sugar Creek is a nice venue, etc. Of all the breweries I've been to, however, I feel like Free Range has been the most consistently expensive with the blandest tasting beer. I understand they market a product that is supposed to be green friendly and I think the concerts they put on are great but I had two $4 dollar half pints at free range and then hopped over to Birdsong and my girlfriend and I each got a pint and the tabs were no different in price. To be honest, I enjoyed the Fake Plastic Trees more than either beer at Free Range and when I've gone there in the past I thought all of their selection was pretty milquetoast. I'm sure I'm just being a penny pincher here but something is off between the correlation of beer quality and price there. /rantended

My boyfriend finally had both the time and motivation to clean house today. Unfortunately the washing machine has crapped out. Any suggestions on someone to call to come look at it?
The apartment complex I live in is having new roof's installed on all of the buildings. I'm watching the workers and it's really puzzling to me as to what they are wearing. Standing on the black roofing paper in mid 90 degree heat, all of the workers are in somewhat heavy, long sleeve black or dark shirts. This would seem to be counter-intuitive to what they should be wearing. If anyone has experience at this type of work in these types of conditions, can you give some insight as to why they may be doing this.
I have only gone shooting once since I moved here, and that was at a competition in GA. I prefer shooting outdoors and recently learned about Foothills Public Shooting Complex (haven't had time to drive out there since I learned of it), but it would be awesome if there is a place closer. I usually shoot rifles, ranges with 200 or 300 yard alleys are ideal.

"So, I want to go do something with a friend that doesn't involve loud places or alcohol like clubs or bars after work/dinner.  Is there really anything like that?  Any museums that stay open until 10pm?  Any cool places to explorer between 7-9:30pm?  If I went to NYC, I could go explorer x, y, or z park and people watch.  I would have endless places I could walk and go look at stuff.  I realize NYC is a very large city compared to Charlotte, however Charlotte is in top 20 populated cities in the USA.  Its close to the population of San Francisco at this point...yet I can think of 100+ things I could do not involving a bar/club in San Francisco.I'm not trying to down talk Charlotte by the way, so hope it doesn't come off that way.  I just am finding it hard to believe that only bar or clubs are the things to do with a friend in the city on a Friday night.If someone could point me to some good ideas, I would greatly appreciate it."
"This hot sauce is called Trini Pepper Sauce, and is a recipe from my family thatâ€™s been passed down from five generations. Every time I took a trip back to Trinidad and Tobago from NC, my grandmother would send hot sauce back with me to share with my friends, and it made me start to think about how I could share it with the world.&nbsp;I just got back from Trinidad and was finally able to secure sourcing of the perfect Scotch Bonnet and Scorpion Peppers for this sauce (it took a while to find the right ones, I can tell more if youâ€™re interested). Iâ€™m doing a free limited sample giveaway. Please try the sauce and tell me what you think! &nbsp;**To get the sauce**Just give us your name and mailing address in this [link!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQJvBgdgMKIIx5mB6TzCGjR6J_dgksGzQAhv4YCGbH5whV5Q/viewform?c=0&w=1) I'd also appreciate any feedback, there's always room for improvement and variety. Please e-mail staff@trinipeppersauce.co with any suggestions/questions.&nbsp;**The Trini Pepper Sauce Taste**This hot sauce is referred to as â€˜peppa sauceâ€™ in Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago is a small country of two islands in the caribbean known for its local cuisine and carnival. Every family has their own recipe and itâ€™s typically added to meals to add flavor and heat. Our peppa sauce is made with freshly picked Scotch Bonnet and Scorpion Peppers imported from Trinidad. It's exciting to introduce a Trinidad style hot sauce in North Carolina, where Texas Pete is the popular sauce, because the flavor is different, and people love it. The flavor is smooth with hints of garlic, culantro (trinidad cilantro), and papaya. It goes great with chicken, eggs, fish, pizzas, wings, and more. Let us know what you like it best on!&nbsp;**Why I want to give you free sample**Iâ€™ve hosted local tasting events, received positive feedback and would like to gain some more. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, as well as any feedback on how we could improve. I plan to roll the momentum and feedback toward my Kickstarter campaign. Here is some of the feedback Iâ€™ve gotten from local events:&nbsp;*Great initial kick, didn't last too long, refreshing, sweet aftertaste. Incredibly flavorful...could even try to pick out all the ingredients. -  Mike H.*&nbsp;*Love the color. Separates itself from your conventional red hot sauce which gets monotonous and expected. The flavors were new and exciting as well. -  Sameer A.*&nbsp;*It has a really unique and fresh flavor. I think that's your selling point -- it doesn't taste processed or sugary and lets the ingredients show through. - Allyson S.*&nbsp;*The spiciness is making me sweat... but the aftertaste is bangin' - Esther L.*&nbsp;*I like the flavor a lot, I feel it is very versatile compared to many existing products.

"Hi guys,I wrote an article for Charlotte Five that was published today regarding HB2 and the All Star game. I think there are some things people are missing and felt compelled to speak out. If you're interested, you can read the article [here](http://www.charlottefive.com/nba-all-star-game-hb2/).I've also started a project called Vote Smarter NC where I'm hoping to break down some of the curtains / smoke screen surrounding local politics. Many don't realize (I certainly didn't) how public a lot of information is, like how our 157 state representatives vote on key issues.For example - of the 157 members of NC Senate / House 114 voted for HB2; 6 from Mecklenburg county. I think this gets lost. It's easy to put Governor McCrory's face to the bill, but there are many more people involved. I did a full breakdown of how each member of the NC Senate & House voted on HB2, as well as created printable PDFs I hope you all will take with you to the polls come November. You can find that all at [WhoVotedForHB2.com](http://www.whovotedforhb2.com/).I genuinely welcome any and all feedback.

"Hello all:I'm the founding admin of Killer Queen City: Charlotte's club league for the Killer Queen arcade game. We have a tounrament coming up this Sunday and I figure that not everyone who might be interested is on Facebook. What's Killer Queen? If you've been to Abari, you might have seen a large set of cabinets with flat screens near the X-Men machine. I would hope that if you saw it you gave it a try. If not:> Killer Queen is a 5v5 competitive strategy game with similar game mechanics to Joust (Arcade Game) and> Quidditch (like, from Harry Potter). Some have described it as a Real Time Strategy game, but to me that > sounds too much like Starcraft. Calling it a MOBA is probably counterproductive, too, but I could see someone > making the argument. Each team competes to win the game in one of three ways that involve dexterity, > strategy, and mind games. It's generally easy to learn and has a high skill ceiling.Those are my words, not the developers'. If you head over to www.killerqueenarcade.com there's lots more including pics and video. While you're there, you might notice that there are only a handful of locations in the WORLD that have KQ, so we're very lucky to be a part of the scene.The Tournament this Sunday will only be our 2nd. If you're new to the game and want to try with some more experienced, enthusiastic players, this will be a great opportunity. The teams will be semi-random in order to spread out the skill pool. We'll also be streaming this tournament on Twitch. You can find Abari's channel at https://www.twitch.tv/abarigamebar**Where:** Abari Game Bar on North Davidson and Parkwood**When:** Sunday, July 31st; Registration starts at 4PM**Who:** YOU! 21+, as the tournament will go past 5PM**How:** Show up and find the table with the guy with the bullhorn**I'm Scared:** Don't be. We're going to have fun."

I got dropped off by a coworker at home today and checked the mail when I got out. As I'm walking toward the house, two dogs from the house next to me came running toward me while barking. I was kind of scared and I'm sure as hell not going to wait and see if they bite me before I defend my self so I started swinging my laptop case at them to try and get away. If I stopped swinging it while walking backwards towards the door, they'd come towards me again. The lady comes out and I tell her she needs to get her fucking dogs. She respond "They're friendly, don't worry" Bullshit lady, most friendly dogs I know want you to pet them, not bark and bark while trying to get at you. Keep in mine this all happened on my driveway and on my property. I definitely do not want to hurt or injure an animal unless I absolutely have to but I'm also not going to wait and see if they bite before trying to distance myself. I live in Gaston County if that matters. Does anyone know to what extent I could have defended myself? These dogs weren't on leashes and came onto my property. If you were to call animal control, would they just come out and talk to the neighbor?

"Hi everybody.I'm visiting  my brother in law, 18 month old niece, and 2 year old Golden Retriever in the coming weeks and need to get the dog in the water.  Can someone recommend a dog and baby friendly lake or river nearby where we can hang out for a few hours?  Given the circus that is traveling with a baby and a young dog (that is well-behaved but LOVES LIFE), we'd like to avoid some of the larger dog parks so the dog can experience water on her own terms.  I have no doubt that she'll be a swimmer, but this ain't my first rodeo and know that the best way to spook a dog when it comes to water is to force them into something that they aren't comfortable with.

I am a (currently) homeless person doing everything I can to get my life back on track. I have secured employment and begin my job Thursday afternoon. My major snag is that I am working in a restaurant and cannot bring my dog in with me. I understand that the logical thing to do would be to find a new home for her, but we've been through all this together, nearly every second of the last five years. She is a service dog, very well-behaved. I am hoping to find someone who would be willing to watch her for a week or two and I can compensate with my first paycheck. It would mean the world to me. Her name is Freya, she's a 5-year old AmStaff. Shes great with kids and male dogs. And usually cats. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

"Hello All, I've relocated to Charlotte from Orlando and was just about to start the process of transferring my license, insurance and registration when I got a nice little speeding ticket. My license and everything is still set in Florida and I just want to make sure I don't run into anything when trying to change it over.    I've seen a post from a while back regarding some advice and there were mixed responses. Some people said to get a lawyer and some said to just go to the court and see if you can get it reduced. I have no idea how that works here in North Carolina and looking for some advice on how to make sure it does not result in points on my license and have any negative effect on insurance when I transfer it over.    Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

"**TLDR:** We've been planning a move to Charlotte for 7 months, but the more we hear about HB2, the more we worry about the economic impact, and its impact on our family. Am I right to be concerned? Do we cancel our move?Hi r/Charlotte!My wife and I currently live in Boston. This past winter, we came to the conclusion had enough of the city and it was time to move on. So began our search for a new place to call home.Long story short, we eventually settled on your fine city, with plans to move after our wedding in September (Yes, we're having a wedding after we've been married for over 2 years. Because, reasons). Then HB2 happened.At first I was really worried. Without getting into how I feel about the law itself (I'd prefer if this thread did not turn into a political debate.), the immediate wave of news detailing musicians cancelling NC shows, and businesses putting plans to expand on hold, was a huge concern for me. I'm an accountant, and one reason we chose Charlotte was the growing economy. But, I thought to myself, *Surely, this won't last forever. And the economic pressure might force change* (Naive? Maybe.). *If it gets really bad we can just move again* Maybe this is a poor sentiment, but the fact that we could easily leave if this starts to have a noticeable economic effect on us was the reason we ultimately decided to stick with our plan (That and the Charlotte area seems great. We've already found a neighborhood we really like in Huntersville, no more New England winters, and we have had nothing but great experiences when visiting).However, every new story of Charlotte getting screwed because of this law has chipped away at my resolve. Last night, I was reading about the estimated economic impact of losing the NBA All-Star game, and I found myself thinking, *It's not too late to change your mind.* So, I could use a little perspective from someone who is actually there. Are Charlotte businesses already feeling the impact of these cancellations?  Does it make sense to be concerned that the City's economic growth might stall because of this?How has HB2 and the subsequent backlash affected you?Should we still move to Charlotte?"


"I only just found out about this. My apologize if this is a repost, but I don't think it is. Charlotte natives who grew up in the central/eastway area will remember her vividly as the friendly lady in an orange jumpsuit with trash bags full of soda cans for recycling. She had been absent from the area for the past 10 or so years, and has been in Mooresville.Recent residents of our city may not know of her,  let alone have ever seen her, but I feel this woman deserves recognition. I saw a comment that suggested she was the ""first lady of recycling"", and I'd have to agree. I personally talked with her only one in my life,  but she had zero enemies,  and was a very kind and loving individual. [Link to obituary](http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?n=&pid=180725009&referrer=0&preview=True)"

Hi folks. This is a bit of an interesting question. My girlfriend is looking for somewhere she can play piano, ideally in private. She doesn't own a keyboard or anything, and used to play in her church when she was a teenager. I'm not from around here, and I'm not a musician, so I can't think of a single place she could go play.

"This might be a long shot, but is anyone here using T-Mobile and\or MetroPCS in Gaston County? I'm one of those no-contract phone people, and this week MetroPCS announced what might be [the greatest $99 phone ever](http://www.cnet.com/news/zte-zmax-pro-lands-at-metropcs-for-jaw-droppingly-low-99/). It's so good that I'm seriously considering switching. But I live in GC, and am worried about coverage there (not that it could be worse than VM\Sprint, but I digress). I assume T-Mobile is A-OK in much of Charlotte proper. While I'm here, I might as well ask: if anyone *is* using MetroPCS, how do they compare to T-Mobile branded service? I ask because although Sprint owns Virgin Mobile and Boost, Sprint's tower-sharing deals only apply to Sprint accounts. So if you're in East Bumble, SC on the way to Myrtle, a Sprint phone might have full service (via a Verizon tower), while a VM phone will have no service at all.Thanks! "

There are two locations here in Charlotte, one in the North Lake area and the other in Pineville.  The folks there are super knowledgeable in the area and the products they're selling.  Share any feedback.  If I missed anything let me know and I can update the list.#Getting Started* It's never a bad idea to find the local ranger or land manager. Stop in for a chat and see what local advice they have. Every area is unique and you must obey local regulations (food storage, permits, closures, etc.).* If you're new day hikes should start out easy. Pick something that's only a few miles/kilometers long and see how difficult it is for you. Everyone hikes at different speeds and prefers different terrain. Hiking to a mountain top is the classic adventure, but down into valleys or towards waterfalls can be rewarding too. Remember that elevation gain is equally important to distance. 1000 ft of elevation gain will typically add 1 hour to a hike. The average hiking speed is 2 miles per hour, depending on conditions / terrain / fitness. * Out-and-back is the popular type of hike. This is where you start at the trailhead, where you park your vehicle, and hike to a certain location - then turn around and hike the same path back. This is ideal for beginners because you know what to expect on the 2nd half of the hike. It also allows you to turn around at any point to shorten the trip. Loop (start and end at the same place but never re-hiking the same section) and Thru/Section (start and end at different places) are other popular types of hikes.* Build up the miles / elevation of these day hikes. Explore more tails and learn the skills of hiking. Understanding how much water to carry, what footwear to use, time management, what gear is required in different conditions, weather forecasting, navigation, and others are critical to successful backpacking and day trips alike.

I've been somewhat outside of the pokemon go game because this is my first day off in almost 2 weeks, so I'd love to make up for it but also have fun doing other stuff! I'm pretty new to Charlotte though and haven't really had the chance to explore, so any suggestions would be much appreciated.Edit: also I got tons of rattatas and pidgeys around my house so any place sans them would be great."

I'm hoping to put together a league tournament if there's enough interest in the Charlotte area, so I'm wondering how many people here play league and if you'd be interested in partaking in such an event. Let me know. If I get enough interest and a place to do the tournament at I'm hoping for September 3rd! Let me know. I have 1 other person that has shown interest and we're both in Bronze atm.
Anyone know of an eevee super spawn point or any not so common pokemon (see: pidgey, rattatat, venonat)?
I salute you.

"The town of Matthews has a proposal for a new cell tower at the Cross & Crown Lutheran Church on the agenda for a hearing on 8/8 - [see details here](http://www.matthewsnc.gov/pview.aspx?id=20799&catid=0).Anyone that lives in the area between 51 & Sardis Rd. North knows how much of a cell black hole this is and this tower would presumably resolve the problem.  Unfortunately, the town hasn't yet received anything other than criticism on the plan and will certainly decline it unless that changes.I'm sending a letter to the town in support of this new tower.  If you live in the area and would like to have your name added to the list of supporters, please PM me with your name & neighborhood and I'll add you.Here's the content of the letter:>>The below signatories would like to voice our approval of the new cell tower proposed at Cross and Crown Lutheran Church.  Mobile phone reception is widely regarded by residents as abysmal in most of the neighborhoods along Sardis Road between highway 51 and Sardis Road North.  This lack of service causes problems ranging from lack of 911 services during power outages to reliance on expensive land lines and carrier-issued microcells.  Additionally, a plague of makeshift â€œcell phone lotsâ€ù has arisen in several neighborhoods â€“ Coachman Ridge as a prime example â€“ wherein drivers park at the entrance to neighborhoods to avoid having their calls drop.  This causes traffic problems that will eventually result in accidents.  Finally, the income from the tower will help Cross and Crown, a respected church in our local community.  We ask the board to approve this cell tower permit."

"Hey everyone!My birthday is coming up this weekend and I still haven't made any plans. I would like to spend it outdoors swimming and doing something exciting (I really want to go wake-surfing but don't have any friends with a boat) so cliff jumping seems like a good idea, but dont know of anywhere to go.

"I understand this post may not come off the best, however, I've made a few post's here recently and had a bit of success. Met plenty of new people, new friends, and trying to be as active and positive as possible. The issue currently being many of the people I have met and talked with have mainly been..male.  While that's not bad in and of itself, I tend to try to be objective on my situations, and opinions, and i feel like things are a bit one sided in my views of how things are currently, and have predominantly male friends.I'm looking to for women around the Charlotte area who would be open to giving advice about questions I have regarding my situation, ways i can improve myself dating/relationshipwise, and even just something simple as much as having conversations, or even going out to certain events. Sometimes it's nice to have the opinions from the otherside, and can open my viewpoints and maybe point out things in a way i couldn't understand before, and if possible, even make some new friends out of it.A little about myself, 27MM, I work in IT support for a living, and have been in Charlotte for about 6 Years. I love the outdoors, and often go walking/running/hiking in the major Charlotte areas. I write poetry and short stories in my spare time, play guitar, and love to cook and bake. I'm a recent homeowner, and am in the process of painting and redoing all the floors, and am pretty set in what i expect for myself for future goals. I've recently come out of a relationship that ended rather unexpectedly, and also sadly have obtained paralysis in my foot, limiting my movement, so I'm trying to deal with that the best I can.If you think you'd be down for any of that, or even friendship, give me a pm, and thanks for your time!"
"So with the news of Google Fiber coming, I checked in on AT&T's gigafiber (as its going to be a while till Google Fiber gets to our area) Gigafiber was just installed in my neighborhood in Steel Creek, at Berewick.

I kind of like TWC's technical service, just their customer support sucks. For the same price, we can update from 300mbs internet to 1gbps, the only difference is the TV package really.So does anyone have any experience moving over? And what do people prefer, DirecTV / uVerse / TWC with regards to TV? We havent yet cut the cord, i really would love to, but the wife likes her TV. =/"

"A friend and I took off work to head out to the whitewater center yesterday. Plans had been made before the amoeba fiasco but we decided to go anyway. The cool sport pass was $50 and they threw in a zip line tour that usually costs extra. It's not whitewater rafting but it was unexpected and nice! Just thought I'd share the experience. They said they will be offering this promotion for a limited time. I imagine it will be offered until whitewater activities resume but I can't say for sure. Edit: spelling is hard"
"... or maybe I'm just far too into fantasy football and crazy for thinking this is even possible.So I listen to a lot of the fantasy football channel on SiriusXM and they were talking last year around this time about cool things different leagues do. It got me to thinking and I came up with an idea that I'd actually be interested in trying out. I'd like to try to set up a 36 team, 3 tiered, ""league."" What I mean is something similar to what soccer does with promotion and relegation. How we'd do it:The first season would basically be 3 brand new redraft leagues. Really nothing different but each would have to have the same rules/scoring system. To start the second season, we'd take the top third of each of the first season to create the premier league. The middle third of each would comprise the 2nd tier and same thing for the 3rd tier.After that, each league would be done much like English soccer. Bottom portion of the premier league gets relegated to 2nd tier and top of 2nd tier promoted. Same for 2nd and third tiers. The way I have it envisioned is three 12 team leagues (pretty much has to be a multiple of 3 just to set up year 2). Year 1, everyone pays the same amount (say $50; maybe plus $5 contribution to get some kind of trophy or something). After that, I'd prefer tier 2 and 3 to pay maybe $5 and $10 extra or something similar to pay winners in tiers 1 and 2 extra. After all, there should be some kind of monetary bonus for winning the better leagues.I don't want to try to do this whole thing on my own because it just sounds like a whole lot more to try to organize than I have time (or the desire to do). If a couple of you might be interested in organizing people and discussing some details, I think it could be a really fun idea.  "


I used to live up north near the university area and received all of the network stations clear as a bell plus PBS and independent stations using just a simple RCA antenna attached to my Samsung flatscreen. Since I've moved to Matthews, I can get ABC, but rarely CBS and NBC and never FOX or PBS. Forget about the independent stations. I'm using the same antenna and I've twisted it around in every direction, but nothing works. My cell phone with Verizon service only gets at most two dots as well. Is Matthews in a depressed signal area?

Hey all! I've been playing Magic for years, and just left an amazing shop back home. I'm a female, so finding a fitting shop that doesn't instantly ostracize me can be really really difficult.

I'm not new to Magic, but I am relatively new to Magic in public (always played with friends or at home) so a "user friendly" shop would be really great too. Thanks in advance!

"I bike to work. I've biked to work everywhere I've lived. I've found Charlotte to have the most hostile motorists in the five cities I've lived and biked.  In one commute in Charlotte, I encounter as much rage, horns, cursing, and aggressive driving as I've encountered in five years in different cities. I'm entitled to bike on the road. North Carolina law and Charlotte ordinances support that truth. Here are some tips and tricks to dealing with cyclists on the road:1. Get your tiny toddler hands off of your horn and put your little cocktail sausage fingers back onto the steering wheel of your F-150, shift into another lane, and pass me in another lane. 2. Pass at a safe distance in a separate lane. Do not aggressive veer into the lane I am in and try to intimidate me. I promise; I am not the problem keeping you from getting to work sooner. It is the several hundred thousand cars on the road doing that. 3. Keep your window rolled-up.  I do not need to or want to hear your opinion of me cycling in front of you.  I do not need to learn any new four-letter words4.  Think about how many cars impede your progress everyday and how much easier and faster it is to pass a bicycle compared to a car. 5. I like cycling on the same road as you even less than you do. If you want to stop sharing the road with me, join me supporting the bike infrastructure this city desperately needs. I would love to cycle on a beautiful path on the way to my workplace separate from the noxious, loud behemoth you drive to work. 6.  I am someone's child, sibling, and spouse, and not just an obstacle on your way to work. "

I am currently scouring craigslist in search of an apartment or someone who needs a roommate, but figured someone here may be able to help me. I am a laid back 26 year old male who likes golf and most other sports, doing anything outdoors, drinking beer and hanging out. TL;DR- was all set to move to Charlotte at the end of the month, but life has thrown me a huge curveball. Can anyone lend a hand? "
Hi all, my wife and I are thinking about moving our family (3 yr old daughter) to the area, but we know very little about it beyond hearing wonderful things. I'd love to hear from locals where the best places to raise a family in the city are, best cost of living, schools, economy etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Have a smartphone with a cracked screen, and wanted to see if their are any local companies like that who buy things like that. Just wanted to explore my avenues before throwing it away. Thank you.

"Found a small black puppy.https://imgur.com/Y6qzpYn He looks to be about 5 or 6 months old. Longish black hair. He had a rubbery blue collar/leash that looks like he chewed through it. I'm taking him to check for a chip tomorrow but haven't found out if he has one yet. He was panicking really badly about fireworks and even though he's very calm and well behaved indoors he panics as soon as we go outside. He's obviously been taken care of. He loved getting a bath, sort of knows sit and lay down(especially for a puppy) and he's never defensive about food. He's an awesome littler dog. I'd love to get him back home."

"Session ended for the year late Friday night. There had been talk all week of a modification to HB2, but nothing surfaced. Going into Friday night's session - the last voting session of the year - we were told to ""expect nothing controversial.""It was getting late, about 9:30 p.m. We finished voting on a noncontroversial bill and moved to the next one. A senator spoke to the new bill for about 20 seconds, describing what sounded like a very technical and uncontroversial matter - and never mentioning HB2.  (The bill had only been introduced as that senator began speaking to it.  No one had a chance to review it prior to that moment.)  He finished his short speech and it was immediately called for a vote.  We were about two seconds away from locking in the voting process when another senator jumped up and put the brakes on - he had spotted that this was the HB2 bill. They had introduced it so quickly that it almost came to vote without anyone realizing what was happening, which was the whole idea.Our senator asked if we could take a 30 minute recess to read the bill. He was denied. So he continued to ask questions to give the rest of us in the minority party time to quickly read the bill and figure out what was in it.As it turned out, it only did one thing: it partially restored the right to sue your employer in state court if you're fired because of your race, gender, religion, age, or disability. HB2 had originally thrown out that right, making NC and Mississippi the only two states without it. This bill restored it, but it also cut the statute of limitations for filing your claim from three years (which is what it had been prior to HB2) to one year.I, and the rest of the minority party, voted against it for two reasons. First, it unnecessarily narrowed the statute of limitations. Second, we continue to believe that any legislation that does not address the core issue behind HB2 - which is discrimination against the LGBT community - is insufficient.Now session has ended without any real action on HB2. It appears the majority party has decided to accept whatever economic consequences this may bring to our state."

Hi all. I'm relatively new to Charlotte, and I need to get my driver's license. I went to the DMV off of W. Arrowood today with all my proper paperwork - it was packed wall-to-wall, folks were yelling at each other and babies were crying. I turned right back around. Ain't nobody got time for that. Is there any way to get my driver's license online or through the mail or do I have to go to one of the hellholes around town and wait hours to get my license? What did you do or do you have any tips on making the process as pain-free as possible? Thanks!

Hey there everyone! Hope you all are having a great 4th!

"[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/7VI6ZQC.jpg)It's the biggest night of the year at the USNWC.  Great music, good beer (bring money and patience...although protip, the bike barn and the kayak barn have much shorter lines than the main beer garden, because no one thinks to look over there, and they also sell beer), great fireworks, and a chill vibe.It's a really pretty venue, not far at all from Uptown Charlotte, but feels like a world away.  USNWC is my family's church, our country club, our gym, my oldest daughter's workplace, etc., we know it backwards, forwards, and inside-out.  We are pretty much always there.  So if you have a question about what to do there, I can absolutely try to answer.As far as the Meetup, my family will be there pretty early today to set up chairs near the band, and we will put r/Charlotte signs on the chairs so you guys know where to set up.  We will try to put the chairs in a pretty big semi-circle so that when it gets crowded, you can set up inside the semi-circle if there isn't room anywhere else.Fair warning, though, we probably won't be IN the chairs much until around 7 or 8.  Maybe off and on, but there's a lot of great activities to do there, and we also have a great hangout we know about that is away from the crowds, and if we see you by the chairs before the sun has gone down enough to make the area comfortable in the heat, we will show you where it is.Last time we had the MeetUp, I realized one important thing...so I'm going to just get this out there, if this is your first MeetUp.  You will probably feel kind of awkward about that first moment of saying, ""Hey, are you the stranger I talk to on the Internet?"" or whatever, but try not to be.  It ended up being so much fun!  Everyone was very different, but that's partly what made it a very interesting evening. ALSO:  Be there somewhat early tonight, because last night parking hit capacity, and parking ALWAYS hits capacity on the 4th, usually by 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  So either bring plenty of water or money for water because you'll be there until past ten waiting for traffic to die down enough to drive home and you don't want to get dehydrated (can you tell I'm a mom of three?....you can, right?)Last night, the parking lot was packed getting out, so we ended up getting back out of the car and walking around for about half an hour until it died down a bit.  Tonight we just won't bother getting in the car until 10:45ish.  Also, they redirect traffic to take a detour to get on Mt. Holly to 485, so make sure you have a way to charge your phone for directions if you've drained it SnapChatting fireworks.I'm excited about today, I love 4th Of July.  I hope some of you are able to make it.  We're going to be there all day, even in this heat and humidity.  We're going to take advantage of the new offer USNWC has for pass buyers and season pass holders where they give you part of the canopy tour that is normally $80 for free, you just have to sign up for it when you get there, just like you used to sign up for a raft time.  And we'll almost definitely do the new 100ft jump.  Have done the 60 ft. twice but 100 ft. was closed both times.Edit: going to delete the reply post with pics of my family to help make us easy to find.  Started thinking about it, and realized that's not a very safe thing to do, i.e. put pics of my kids on Reddit for any stranger to see. _Ÿ˜_"

"I'll probably have new job opportunities in Charlotte soon and am wrestling with myself on whether to move back there.

So I would love to talk (privately or not) with somebody who has made or faced a similar move.I have searched and read other posts on this sub regarding ""why should I move / not move to Charlotte?"" Some of my reservations popped up there, too.Anyway, I'm guessing that if this post resonates at all with you, you are probably somebody I want to talk to!

"This is probably one of the hardest things for me to do. I made a thread once, and my life derailed with someone i fell in love with, and I never got the chance to followup. I've recently had some troubling events in my life which have left me a little depressed, and I'm reaching out to try and do something about it.  I don't have any plans this weekend, and would like to meet some people who would be supportive and maybe to lend an ear, whilst maybe going out on the town, helping introduce me to people, or just getting my mind off things.Now for the hard part, I was just recently left by a girl i fell in love with 5-6months ago. She told me she didn't feel anything for me since the beginning, but stuck with me because i was "" a great guy"". My feelings were real, but all of that felt like a lie, and it really does hurt. We had a 4th of july trip i took off extra time for, but now obviously its cancelled. She still wants to be friends( i thought i wanted to also, but i just realized i wasn't letting go), and tries to talk to me everyday, even though she said we should take some space, so i've decided to start ignoring her to try to move on. On top if it, 2 days later i had a spasm in my right leg, which paralyzed my up movement on my foot(drop foot) so now i have trouble walking.All of this hit me within a couple days, and i've been really up and down lately. A lot of the friends i know are too busy, or don't care enough to support me through this, and it's hard for me to do things alone in this state, so I'm looking for supportive people who might be able to help me out.A little about myself, I'm a 27year old male, I work in IT, and love the outdoors. I like going out to visit parts of charlotte, I love hiking and walking amongst scenery, and am open to just about anything. I really appreciate any posts and help, and can go further into details later. I'll be off until july5th, where i return to work on the 6th. Thanks!"

"Hey,Apologies upfront if this is answered elsewhere, but I didn't see much in Charlotte regarding renting on the landlord side. I'm thinking about actively managing and renting my own house out (instead of using a management company), and I am having trouble finding NC or Mecklenburg-specific rules, suggestions, etc. So if you have experience, I have a few questions! All of my questions are based on random articles I've read, tidbits of county laws I've found, and my personal experience, so if I'm way off the mark on something, let me know!**Background**: I bought a house to live in, but due to some external issues (I wanted to do an addition, but the HDC said no), I moved out and want to rent the house out full-time. I travel about 50% of the time for work, but when Iâ€™m home Iâ€™m available essentially 24/7. Iâ€™m also available by phone pretty much all the time. Iâ€™ve been Airbnbing the house for a few months, and while Iâ€™m tired of cleaning up after people all the time, I donâ€™t mind putting in the upfront work of getting a tenant and answering calls. The house is a single-family home that was completely renovated a couple years ago and (in my opinion) is very nice and modern. While Iâ€™d love to make bank on the house, itâ€™s more about having good tenants that will take care of the property while just covering my costs (until the HDC gets their head out of their ass and I can do what I like. Or I give up. Either way.) On the same vein, I want to make sure Iâ€™m doing this the right way. *Ok, so.*â€¢	Besides registering with CMPD, is there anything I need to do with the city or police to get started?â€¢	Why did you decide to actively manage instead of use a company?â€¢	Any sites or outlets I should use to advertise besides the usual Zillow, Craigslist, Padmapper, etc? Any tips on how best to advertise? Do you use a lock-box to allow people to look at the house themselves or do you go with prospective tenants? Do you work with realtors or no?â€¢	Do you have a lawyer that you work with for evictions, handling security deposits, etc? Do you keep them on retainer, or just know that they are available? Any recommendations on firms or lawyers?â€¢	Do you have the law firm hold onto the security deposit, or where do you hold onto it?â€¢	Do you recommend using anything other than the standard NC lease? Anything extra that you recommend be covered in the lease?â€¢	Most management companies use a credit and background check (ie using a service like Mysmartmove). Do you do anything extra? If someone has bad/no credit, do you have other verifications or do you automatically deny?â€¢	I personally have no problem allowing pets (I had dogs at my house before deciding to rent), but do you like/allow them? Anything I should know ahead of time other than the pet addendum? â€¢	Do you have a dedicated handyman for repairs? Where did you find them? Any recommendations on specific people? Do you keep them on retainer with a contract or any sort, or is it all piece-work? Do you try to do work yourself before calling them, or do you use them whenever thereâ€™s an issue? Any qualifications that you recommend they have (like being a certified electrician, being bonded, etc)?â€¢	Anything you think a new landlord should know?

"Hey all! After fighting and clawing to find a job to replace the one I lost in December (due to a horrific car accident requiring months off), I finally got around to finding something and I'm moving to Charlotte from Atlanta. I'm very excited, I love Charlotte (my brother lives in the Cornelius/Lake Norman/Davidson area) and I know it's going to be great.I'll be living with my brother for about a month or two until I get funds from new job to put a deposit on an apartment; he has an old couch, chair/ottoman combination and while the construction is good, it's VERY dated (early 80's) and I'd like it reupholstered and refinished. Anyone know of a good place to search or wanna recommend someone?I'm also gonna be looking at apartments/roommates for when I move; any areas to avoid would be fantastic. I might have something with an old friend in Dilworth, but it's a VERY expensive condo that his roommate bought (now no longer lives in), so I dunno if I can afford rent there. I'm budgeting no more than $700, but would like to stay $600-$650 (of course without utilities). Any recommendations for complexes or property management companies and ZIP codes would be great! (I've already started parsing through the Sidebar)Can't wait to be there in September."

"So I learned this week that my driver's license has been under a ""SUSPENDED"" condition for over 3 years, and not at all to my knowledge. Some background to this situation may be necessary to understand this unique situation, so here goes:I was last ticketed the very morning I moved here to Charlotte, passing through Alamance County along I-85. I had never driven a certain terrible stretch of highway and failed to notice the signs where it drops down to 55MPH (non-construction zone) and got nabbed for doing 70 in a 55. However, I suppose that in the weeks that followed I got caught up in getting set up in my new place and school starting and everything that I forgot to pay the fine (not the greatest excuse I know, but stuff was crazy those few weeks). I also never received a notification from the DMV saying that my license was suspended, despite setting up a forwarding address with the USPS from my old address to my new one.Now the dilemma; with my license set to expire in a few weeks, do I need to go about requesting a hearing in the county I was originally ticketed in (Alamance) to reinstate my license before renewing it? [Seen Here](http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_20/GS_20-24.1.html) Or, can I simply apply for a new one and not have to worry about my current one being ""suspended""? I am willing to take either route, despite one being vastly more inconvenient; I am just wondering whether or not it is possible to request a ""new"" license instead of ""renewing"" my suspended one. Thanks for any advice, however legal or illegal it may be."

I'm going to condense this into a few ""what you need to know"" tips, tricks, and links so buckle up.  â€¢	The festival officially begins at 12:00 on Saturday August 20th, taking up Tryon Street from Trade all the way to Stonewall. (The main stage is all the way down by Stonewall.)  â€¢	The streets will be lined by booths from businesses, vendors, and non-profits. Beer and wine are available for purchase after receiving a wrist band from the alcoholic beverage vendor's booth. â€¢	Both stages have a list of the who and what of performers as well as some performers providing entertainment in the VIP tent. (I never get invited there) http://charlottepride.org/entertainment/â€¢	The parade will be held down Tryon and then down Trade Sunday starting at 1:00 it will last approximately two hours depending on how many costumes changes the drag queens insist on.â€¢	 Both Saturday and Sunday night various ""famous"" performers will be performing at extremely crowded local bars and clubs with sky high cover charges. You can PM me if you wish to know what places always reach capacity by 11pm and which are usually a good bet.  â€¢	Lastly is parking, it will be the weekend so lots of metered spaces are free, you can usually find the best spots North of Trade and Tryon such as 7th or 8th streets, I usually have decent luck on Church as well.  â€¢	Good luck, be safe, we're really quite a fun crowd."

"Charlotte may not have the traffic problems of Manhattan or LA, but I'm sure everyone will agree there's some terrible driving habits occurring on a daily basis here nonetheless.  Here's a few of my suggestions.  Let me know if there are any I've forgotten:* The left lane is for passing.  If you are driving in the left lane and someone is behind you, move over.  If you are in the left lane to pass someone, but can't muster up the speed to pass them while other cars are behind you, swallow your pride and move over.* Try to keep up with the flow of traffic.  If the speed limit is 55, you are not safer going 40.  You are safer going the same speed as everyone else.* Don't tailgate.  Even if you're stuck behind an asshole hogging the left lane, if he mashes on his brakes guess who's still going to be at fault for the accident.  Tailgating also causes traffic.  If you have to hit your brakes every time the person ahead of you slows down, then the person behind you hits their brakes and so on.  Giving enough space between you and the car ahead of you to coast a little before you have to brake helps keep the flow going. * Use your blinker.  Another useful way to avoid an accident.  Also, be sure to use your blinker well enough in advance for the people behind you to react to it.  If you're already applying your brake by the time you've turned on your blinker, you've turned it on too late.* There is no need to speed through a residential area.  Maybe you don't speed in *your* neighborhood, but be sure to extend the courtesy to other peoples' neighborhoods as well.* Don't blare loud music with your windows down in residential areas.  Nobody wants to know what you're listening to.  Also, I don't know why, but 100% of the time I see people doing this they are listening to something shitty anyway.  There is a time and a place to rock out, and it isn't a residential neighborhood at 2am.* Don't throw your bottles/cans/other trash out of your window.  Not only does it look nasty, but a can thrown out of a window at 65 mph becomes a hazard for everyone else.* If you are pulling onto a road, accelerate quick enough that the cars behind you don't have to hit their brakes.* If you are merging onto the interstate hit the fucking gas!  If you slow down or (god forbid) stop when merging into a road with moving traffic, you are merging wrong.* If you are in the rightmost lane on the highway be prepared to let people merging in.  Unless they have slowed to a crawl or come to a complete stop.  In that case, let them wait so they can think about how they've failed to merge.* Stay in your lane.  Those lines in the road are there for a reason.  Trying to eat a burger, or calling your SO, or posting a fucking tweet are not valid reasons for not paying attention while driving a 4,000 LB machine.* When at a 4 way stop sign, the person who stopped first has the right of way.  If you are that person, don't try waving at the other car to take your turn, just go.* Look both ways at least twice before pulling out into traffic. Trying to eat a burger, or calling your SO, or posting a fucking tweet are not valid reasons for not paying attention while driving a 4,000 LB machine.* When the sun goes down, turn your lights on.  If it is raining hard enough to use your wipers, turn your lights on.  Maybe you can see without them, but that doesn't mean other cars will be able to see you.* Change lanes one at a time.  If you missed your exit, don't swerve across 3 lanes of traffic.  Swallow your pride and turn around at the next exit.  Being late is better than killing yourself or someone else.* Parking.  Don't set up camp with your blinker on waiting for someone to fill their car with groceries and pull out, *especially* if there are other spots available. For one, in the time you spent waiting, you could have parked and walked your lazy butt into the store.  For another, it is inconsiderate to the other people trying to park and for the person whose spot you're waiting for.  I take my sweet time loading my groceries whenever somebody pulls this shit on me.* Be considerate.  Driving doesn't need to be a headache.  The more we take the time to learn and obey the rules of driving etiquette, the better and safer the driving experience will be for all of us.  Happy motoring!"

"Hey r/charlotte,I have recently graduated and accepted a job in Charlotte and am trying to decide where to live. I am working right off the northern interchange of 485 and 77, so its fairly in the middle of Huntersville and Downtown.  Huntersville is a much more affordable option, but I'm curious about how young the area is. If I lived downtown, I know there would be no shortage of things to do, and there would be plenty of people around my age.  I don't want to live in Huntersville If i'm going to end up taking an uber to downtown every weekend. I don't know anyone in Charlotte, so living in an area where young professionals are would be ideal.Thanks for any input offered!Edit: Thanks for all the input! Y'all confirmed what I was assuming to begin with. I Ended up finding a place in Noda for a good price"

"Every time I get on 77 or 277, I feel like I'm gambling my life. I don't even know where to start. I lived in NYC for 5 years - driving there seems like a cake walk in comparison. No one uses their blinkers, people weave in and out of the lanes in sharp turns with no warning, they tail you, pass you on the right even when your blinker is on to merge right, jump to the front of the line to get onto 77 and back up the right lane of 277 doing so, don't even LOOK when they merge.This isn't a racetrack. It's a road with a bunch of people all trying to go to and from work.I'm at the point where I don't want to leave my house."




Hey there /r/charlotte! It's time for another brewery meetup! We'll be heading to [Birdsong Brewing](https://birdsongbrewing.com/?age-verified=e0915a05bf) this week for the first time in a while. With a selection of beers in just about [any style you could want](http://birdsongbrewing.com/beers/), Birdsong has something for everyone! They unfortunately do not have a food truck on Tuesdays but being in the NoDa area, there are plenty of great places to eat in the area.
In general the best schools in Charlotte are in South Charlotte but of course housing is expensive there so I am sure there are plenty of people who live closer to the city or even near the not-so-safe neighborhoods. Assuming you are not okay with your child going to a not-so-safe school, What do you do for your kid/future kid's education situation?

"I figure with over 15,000 people who live in actual Uptown Charlotte and plenty more which live just on the other side of the 277 ring there have to be at least a few MtG nerds who done good for themselves. Getting to and back from ""Get Some Game"" or ""Rebel Base"" (I hear that they have a play area, but I've never seen it the couple times I've been in there) can be something of a hassle from uptown especially on a Friday if you want to participate in FNM.Is there any interest in an organized MtG League that meets in uptown on a weekend day and doesn't go so long into the night that we 30/40-something office workers will fall asleep at the table? For example maybe Sunday Noon to 4/5/6pm?I'm thinking maybe Chaos Draft and/or Highlander.Most apartment buildings in Uptown have communal areas which would be excellent places for playing Magic or other games on a weekend afternoon. The building I'm in now (on 4th Street near J&W Univ.) could easily accommodate a group as large as 20 on a Sunday afternoon.My experience with playing at the LGS is that it's really hit or miss (mostly miss) on whether you can play a hand of anything but Draft. An organized league with a signup process (so you know people will be there) in the uptown area could be great, if there's interest in it."

It got me thinking that there should be text to 911, but it's already available in some places, including almost every ring city surrounding Charlotte (although our fair city isn't on the list yet).  Did you know this exists?  Have you used text to 911?  Do they accept photos? (it looks like SMS only, so I guess no)  [FCC link about text to 911](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/what-you-need-know-about-text-911)"
I know this has been asked just a few weeks ago on here but I had a somewhat more specific question pertaining to the DMV offices around here. Has anyone been to the office located off Monroe and Independence in the Independence Shopping Center? That's the closest location to me I can find but I don't know how bad the lines will be and didn't know if anyone could lend me any insight as to what to expect if I get there right when they open. Also, I am a bit confused because I'd never heard of this branch before and I want to make sure I can get an identification card if I go here and won't be sent elsewhere. I've tried calling but they never seem to pick up or will just keep transferring me. Any bit of information would be much appreciated. Thanks!
2" receiver hitch extension to be exact.  Had a friend have a hole already drilled in it for free but I f'ed and didn't check to make sure I could get the extension all the way into the hitch and get the pin through.  Needless to say I don't want to impose a 2nd time but still need a hole through.

Hey there everyone! It's almost time for another brewery meetup. This week we'll be heading to [Legion Brewing](http://legionbrewing.com/) in the Plaza Midwood area. Legion is an excellent up and coming brewery who are well into their first year of business and preparing an [excellent array of beers on tap](http://legionbrewing.com/beer/). I know I for one can't wait to try the new berry saison. Unfortunately Legion does not have its own kitchen or food truck, however there is a great pizza place they associate with that delivers. I hope to see you all there!
"I'm going to be selling my truck witch has a lien on it and the lienholder is not local which complicates things. I am looking for an escrow service to take care of assuming the payment from the buyer, handle the payoff, and transfer the title into the buyers name - basically ensuring a secure transaction for both parties. Seems like a much better alternative then waiting for payment to clear, paying it off myself and having to wait a week to get the title before signing it over to the buyer as that would require a leap of faith for both parties involved.Anyone know a reputable vehicle escrow service offered in the area? Everything I've searched for seems to be aligned more towards the real-estate domain.Thanks"

Hello Charlotte! I will be in the area next week visiting for my little sister's wedding that will be held in Rock Hill, SC. We had a rental lined up but the renter dropped out on me just yesterday! A bit of a drag, but it was through Craigslist, idk what else i expected tbh..... anyway, im looking for some short term rentals in the area preferably closer to Rock Hill, but 30-45 mins away is fine. Any suggestions? Also worth noting, the groom is from there but has no extra place for people to stay at because he is housing the men from his wedding party, my sister and her soon to be husband wil not be living in SC, so they don't have a place for anyone to use either, we will be looking to house about 10 family members and would need at least 3 rooms. I know I'm asking a lot but any help would be super! thanks for any help this might get us!

"Hey r/charlotte, we need your help.My wife and I have a very sweet hound dog mutt who we are trying to find a home for. Our time and space have both dwindled since we adopted her, and the truth is that none of us are living our best life right now. We know that there are rescues and a humane society in town, and we'll look into those options if it comes to it, but we wanted to try and match her up with the right person directly first.http://imgur.com/a/TKygDAbout her:She's a hound dog / beagle mix - skinny and fast with a very loud bark that would be great for treeing a raccoon or scaring off burglars. She loves to run and would make a great partner to someone who is looking for a running buddy.She's nervous around people, and that manifests in to barking like crazy if she sees anyone walking down the street, near the yard, or toward the door. She panics every day when the UPS truck drives by and when the neighbor kids play in the street. Our neighborhood is a new development with about five feet between houses, so she's highly anxious most of the time, inside and outside, day and night. We have tried the thundershirt, hormone spray, and puppy prozac. I think what she really needs is to live in a home with a bit more space between neighbors, and we won't be able to offer that for at least a few more years.She is a bundle of energy and needs room to run on her own or someone who can spend a chunk of time every day exercising with her.She sometimes pees when she's nervous/excited.She is very sweet and affectionate - loves to snuggle and is very patient with our toddler and newborn.We know that this is not ideal, and it would be great if things were lining up better and we were able to keep her. However, after a couple of years of trying and failing to make it work, this is where we're at - and we would rather place her directly into a happy home than have to subject her to shelter life for any length of time. If she sounds like a good match for you or someone you know, please get in touch. I can provide more pictures or more details via private message if you're interested. "

As such, I need to register my vehicle here and change my tags over. I want to get this done as quickly as I can and avoid making multiple trips.So, first question: can I get my North Carolina license (currently have CT ID and tags) and my car registered at the same place? There seems to be a lot of confusion as to whether or not you can get them at the same place. If not, can you at least get your ID and car registered in the same day at the different locations? I reallllllly don't want to make multiple trips if I don't have to. Secondly, do I need to switch my car insurance over to North Carolina prior to getting my license and car registered or do I need to get my car registered/ID first then switch my car insurance to North Carolina? No one seems to know the answer to this, and I can't find the answer to this question on the DMV website. Lastly, what's the deal with the car inspection? I can get that done after I get my tags correct? This whole process is so confusing, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks! "

My mother got a quote from Christenbury eye center for $8,750 for both eyes after a $2,000 discount (so $10,750 regular price). I'm sure there are a lot of factors that go into it but after a little googling it seems like it should be closer to $4,500.
It's orange out there. This is crazy.

Hi everyone.  We are looking to have some work done on our home. Specifically, we would like to have a fence installed in our backyard (likely wood or vinyl), replace our back door and frame, and rebuild our smallish back deck. Ideally this would be all the same company but it's not mandatory. Obviously we would like to save where possible but not at the expense of quality. Can anyone recommend a company or individual for this kind of work in Charlotte? General advice for choosing someone is also welcome. Thanks!

"Hi all, I'm a senior at Hopewell high school doing my senior exit required for my graduation. For this project we (seniors) have to do any service that can benefit someone else and relates to our future career fields. This has been hard to plan for me and other future computer science majors because our teachers have no idea what we could do for this project that relates to computer science. I thought about it some days ago and I decided that I would either find some place to fix computers as volunteer work or that I would build my brother a gaming computer. I have a (older) gaming level computer and its very inconvenient when one of us is on it and the other can't play anything on it so having 2 systems would be beneficial. As much as that second option seems like what I would love to do, I don't have the funds for it and there's no computer stores in Charlotte (with the exception of best buy who hasn't replied to my 4 emails) I'm lost as to what to do here after emailing 4 electronics stores and having them not reply at all.

"Let me start with I can't find a news article anywhere, so I'm not 100% sure about the accuracy of what I've been told. A friend of mine's husband is a CMPD officer. All officers have averaged about 16hr days this past week. She told me that her husband was told Thursday that no officer will receive overtime for protecting our city during the riots and protests, but that they ""may"" receive comp time. I am so angry right now.  I believe in Black lives matter, and I believe in supporting our police and emergency units. Being pro- one doesn't mean anti- the other. But I can't believe that we are taking such poor care of those who are supposed to protect us. Just needed to vent. I wish the Charlotte Observer would report on this. "

"My vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure. It's dead as a door nail. I don't want to pay a lot of money to have it towed home. If I simply abandon it and the state ~~toes~~ **TOWS** it away will they bill me for towing it?I called NC Highway patrol. They said they will flag it and then tow after 24 hours (or sooner if it's deemed a hazard). If I wanted it back I'd have to pay the tow company but the trooper I spoke to did not know if their towing contractors would send me a bill if I never try to get it back. **UPDATE** "" Junk a Car in Charlotte "" offered me $350 and he  is going to pick it up off the side of the road in an hour or so at no cost to me.  By far the best offer I got. More than double what anyone else offered.**UPDATE 2** "" Junk a car in Charlotte"" Dude did **NOT**get the car last night as promised. His tow driver was too late getting back from other pickups so he left a message. Unfortunately not on my phone...he called the wrong number! He left me waiting 2 hours for his call. I eventually called HIM. He apologized,  rescheduled. He SAID he'd pick it up today. Didn't need me there in person but needed me or my spouse on the phone during pickup. Said he'd call today when he was there. No contact. We've been calling him ALL day, no answer. I am displeased. Will update again after I get this situation resolved on way or another. **UPDATE 3** I think this guy is either has a seriously dumbass employee or HE is some sort of fucktard and/or shady dude. He said his employee went out to the vehicle location and tried to contact us, supposedly left multiple messages (complete bullshit, literally did not get even one phone call all day-we are not big phone users and we were specifically WAITING by the phone and checking for calls. Plus, when I asked him to tell me what number I was calling from he transposed some numbers and got it WRONG). I FINALLY got the company on the phone tonight. Talked to a new guy. He relayed above info and said something about them wanting to lower their offer due to an after market catalytic converter being on the car. I don't know that they've even seen the car and I figure this is some sort of standard (shitty) negotiating practice they do and tell him definitively **bullshit** that's an OEM part and it's the original factory part It's never been touched. It's, literally, the part that was on the car at the time of the original purchase. (Note:jaguar does not manufacture this part).....anyway he tells me to talk to the original guy I spoke with...but he's not their until tomorrow AM.  I'm planning on calling tomorrow (Thursday) morning. If he wants to negotiate a little that's cool. I just want to get my dead car off the shoulder of the highway and maybe get a few bucks for it. But I won't tolerate some scammy low-ball bullshit offer, I'd rather call Pull-Apart and have them come get it. (they'd give me just over 1/2 this guys original offer). Or I'll just pull the (fucking expensive$200) battery, tires,  and leather seats, sell 'em myself,  let the state haul the rest away. **PS**- if anybody wants make me an offer on this car PM me. I'm off work tomorrow, I'll sign the (completely clear!) title over.  It can be yours for only **$325 OBO!!! ** Just needs...well, it does need an engine...but other than that it's Fantastic!Thanks all."

"Here it is Charlotte! Your chance to spread some love in an otherwise confusing and often dark world. The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!All you ""Negative Nancy's"" and ""Grumpy Cats"" ought to give it a try. It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.I'll get the ball rollin' as an example, and recall my barbershop experience. Use it as a sort of template if you want, or kick it freestyle on your own.SHOUT OUT to the boys at **Matthews Barbershop II** for the most awesome experience, and top notch haircut and beard trim. Taking time to do something right is a trait hard to find these days, in my opinion, and you fellas obviously have pride in what you do. An excellent atmosphere with smiles, and even a few good laughs. Definitely a ""good guy"" experience with a touch of that old school barber vibe. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... I'll never go to Great Clips again! Thumbs up, gentleman! I hope many other rapscallions, both bearded and clean shaven, find their way to one of your chairs. Now, see how easy and painless that was? I bet you've got a smile now, don't you? DON""T YOU?!

Our thoughts are with you, please stay safe.
"There is a powerful movement in America right now. It is a movement that revolves around issues of equality and justice, and it takes many forms including Black Lives Matter and LGBQT groups. Whatever your opinion is on recent events, you must recognize that this movement exists, will grow, and needs to be taken seriously. In recognizing that, a person must think about the relationship they will have with such a movement. Are you going to physically participate? Will you lend emotional or vocal support? Are you going to take a position of opposition, and how will you express your dissention? I am not here to tell you what kind of relationship you should have with this movement. I want to share, as simply as I can, my opinion on how to approach this movement â€“ no matter how your involvement manifests.Show Maturity and Respect. At the Charlotte protests last night I was struck by the number of people, of all races, treating the civil unrest as a social event. The demographic last night was predominately young people â€“ my generation and younger. This is the case at many similar gatherings around the country. Before you attend a protest, or similar gathering PLEASE:-Remember you will be filled with adrenaline. There will be a physical reaction in your body that will give you energy. It may make you want to run, fight, laugh, or scream. Be mindful of this before you go. Be mindful of this in the moment. Consider why you are there and act accordingly. -Remember you are representing your cause. Remember the power and prevalence of media. If you are not present to participate in a serious and influential way, in a way that furthers your cause, then go find another place to enjoy yourself. Itâ€™s okay not to participate, it is not okay to goof around and detract from the power that your peers are fighting for. Just look at the pictures and videos from last night â€“ are you seeing the message you were fighting for in the headlines, or are you seeing pictures of broken windows and looted stores?Think Critically. Take a moment before you write, speak, or act and consider your position. Consider your oppositionâ€™s position. Consider your goal. Does your action advance your cause?Engage. Donâ€™t ignore or drown out opposing voices - engage them. Actively listen and respond with thought out arguments. If a person is not showing you that same respect, they are not worth confronting. Request a back-and-forth conversation. Express an interest in their opinion. Make your opposition explain their opinion thoroughlyâ€_that is often the best way to get someone thinking about their position. It can be hard to listen to hate, vitriol, and ignorance â€“ but take those moments to learn about who you are fighting against. Take that time to humanize your opposition because these are the people you need to influence. These ideas may not apply to every situation. There may be times when caution and critical thought are thrown to the wind and a blindly passionate stance is justified. I believe, however, that both sides of this movement need to adjust their relationship with it. Letâ€™s take a step back so that we can actually move forward. No one is going to be happy with the outcome of this movement if it continues as it has been. No one is going to change their mind, and the gaps between us will only widen.  It is time to accept that we can be incredibly different people, even hate one another, and still battle in a way that ends in progressâ€_even if that progress is slow and painful.These thoughts were heavy on my mind after witnessing the protests last night, and seeing the response to it among my peers on social media. If you read this far, I am eager to hear your thoughts â€“ here or privately. Respect â€“ Think â€“ Engage "
"""Be excellent to each other.""I just wanted to remind everyone that the violent protestors don't represent all of us and that we need to be excellent to one another, even more so now than we usually are. Go out of your way, if it's not too much, to be nicer to those around you: co-workers, family, friends, neighbors, your uber driver, or even a stranger that may need a tiny bit of help. Let's remind ourselves that while there may be some bad stuff going on right now, that we're still capable and have the capacity for being good.And don't forgetPARTY ON DUDES!SAN DIMAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL RULES!"
Hope you all stay safe, and can recover when this ends. 

"Hello All!First off I want to begin by saying I hope everyone is staying safe with the current riots that have been going on in Charlotte. I was able to visit for a week from Chicago and just wanted to share my trip since some asked me to share my thoughts after my trip.Me and my girlfriend stayed at a VRBO (like AirBnB) that was across the street from the Charlotte Knights stadium. I have lived in Kansas City, MO and now back in Chicago. Charlotte reminds me most of Kansas City, with is large growth, medium sized city and lots to do. Overall I like Charlotte more than Chicago and KC. Your city is super quiet, I felt very safe all the time, your skyline is beautiful and everyone we met was extremely nice.  **Some Items We Did*** Rented SkiJet on Lake Norman* Lunch Boat Tour on Lake Norman* White Water rafting at US National Whitewater Center* Hiked Crowders Mountain * Nascar Museum We had lunch and dinner downtown a lot, relaxed at Romare Bearden Park and visited the Knights stadium and Panthers Stadium as well.**Positives***just some things we really liked** LOTS to do around the area! Everything in the downtown in a good walking distance* The Knights stadium may be one of the best stadiums for minor league baseball. I love a good city backdrop as well.* Everyone was super nice* Not a ton of homeless around uptown and not a lot of people like street performers (Bucket drums, etc)*Every apartment building seemed brand new, and I could count 5 new complexes straight from my apartment**Negatives*** We noticed in uptown you guys have turn lanes but not a lot of turn signals on the lights, we found this odd* Not a lot of public transportation but I saw the rail line being built from the college and it looked great* No green bike lanes in the city which we found odd because Charlotte seemed to green and active, also you guys have the rent-a-bike system a lot of cities have* We had the misfortune of coming back from Lake Norman during the football game. The police would not let us drive the 20ft to our apartment because it was blocked off, instead we had the pleasure of spending 1.5 hours driving about 6 blocks where the other end of the street was blocked off. We tried speaking to an officer and he laughed and said we should've known about the game even though we were out of towners. It seemed like the police blockage caused more traffic than just lights. I've left blackhawks, whitesox, cubs and bears games and everything gets cleared out much quicker that a panthers game. Even for cubs in wrigleyville with neighborhoods. I felt traffic cleared up quicker once police let the lights do their thing. I am probably wrong though!Overall we LOVED Charlotte and would love to come back. Several friends said they did not picture Charlotte to be as big as it was. It has been a city I have wanted to move to for a long time and was great to finally visit. Enjoy your great city!* [Here are some pictures from our trip](http://imgur.com/a/650NQ)P.S. KC bbq is better than Carolina bbq ;)Stay safe everyone! "

"First of all, I'm NOT looking for upvotes, so please don't feel obligated to click that button... I'm not a karma whore, and I'm not doing this for attention or notoriety.I was born in Charlotte in 1982, and since then I have always called Charlotte my home. I've seen good, bad, and in between, but my soul hurts as I am witnessing the things happening, and reading and hearing the vile things people have been saying. Once upon a time, for reasons I don't want to get into, this song helped me through an extremely difficult time in my life. I'm not trying to use this as a peaceful ""cyber"" protest, because quite frankly I'm not on any side. I just want the madness to stop. My personal experience is in no way on a level that can compare to what's going on right now, but I hope some people can hear this song and take it's meaning to heart. We can not lose hope or faith in ourselves as a society, or as a city that has been the outspoken leader against so much hate and discrimination lately in our community.

hey guys my boss wants me to come into work today 8-5. I work on Tryon Street. do you think the worst of the rioting has subsided or will it start up again this afternoon/tonight?

My wife and I are supposed to be going to a concert tomorrow night at the Charlotte Metro Credit Union Amphitheater. I'm not sure how close that is to the riots, but would it be safe for us to come, or should we just stay home? We are coming from Greenville, SC.

Got an automated call.  Anyone working uptown can work from home, and if they are unable to, will not be required to take PTO.

In light of the riots...
I want to go uptown to protest etc. but no one will go with me or anything & I have no friends anyway so I am a female I don't want to go completely alone can I tag along with anyone or is there a gathering/somewhere we all meet up ?

I'm on mobile, forgive typos. I'm staying at the Holiday Inn City Center which is right up the street. College and Trade were a mess for about an hour and a half. Multiple loud bangs, what looked like year gas, and some broken windows. I have a few pictures and videos but I can't upload them right now. About 10 times the crowd started running towards 6th ...sometimes those panics were associated with loud bangs or sirens...sometimes they were brief and everyone turned back around quickly. The mood here ebbed and flowed. It was very tense for a while, that's when a trash can was thrown through a window right near me and people reported shootings (no confirmation on that from me). Other times people were laughing and seemingly enjoying the spectacle of it all. It was kind of guy wrenching to see that side of it...it gave me an appreciation for how quickly these situations can get sidetracked from the rightous purpose that was intended. Mostly a young crowd. Some with signs, many well dressed. 80% black and the rest a mingle of other races.  The only tensions seems to be between protesters and police, not race to race. As I'm typing this I'm overhearing people say that protesters got into The Ritz and the Charlotte Hornets gift shop and trashed some it. Other stores or businesses might be affected (CVS?) The main group moved towards fourth I think. I'll check back in if anything devlops.
"Dunno what it was, and I can't even tell what direction it came from, or how far away it was.This is in the SE suburbs."

"Omni hotel was under attack. Police in full riot gear came in and are shooting gas and flashbangs. Vehicles being destroyed near epicenter.

I'm supposed to be visiting Charlotte tomorrow night and I'm trying to figure out where the demonstrations, disturbances, riots, etc have been taking place and are likely to take place tomorrow - I'd rather just avoid those areas, if I can. Thanks!



So I recently switched to T Mobile and I work in Uptown. That was probably a horrible mistake. It shows I get 3 bars of LTE but the service is god awful in Uptown and where I work. Does anyone have any thoughts on whether Verizon or AT&T have any faster speeds because at this rate I'd rather pay the premium for something that works.


Been seeing a few Facebook statuses vaguely discussing a meetup at Marshall Park at 7pm. Any idea what's going on?
"Hello community! I hope this evening finds you well. I don't want this post to sound like a begging post but it might. Anyways, I have a passion for music since I was in middle school which was a while back. Currently I've kept it as a hobby and volunteered at churches mostly being either music minister, leading choirs, or praise teams. I have an amateur recording setup at my house and record some. I play everything from keys, guitar, electric bass and acoustic bass, drums and sing. I am very talented in all of these and enjoy it very much. So to the meat of this post. Currently of course, I work a full time job as an outside sales rep for an industrial supply company and I'm almost sick of it and currently I am actively seeking other career opportunities. I don't mind this industry, however with the experience I have and a BS in business management from Winthrop I feel I should be elsewhere that's more appreciative of my talents. I am hoping that by post this here I either A. Get a full time music gig that pays a living. B. Gets another career interview for a more flexible and better paying job. C. Vent to someone who's just as frustrated as I am. Anyways, thanks for the help or just reading. Stay safe out there CLT"
Due to some unfortunate circumstances, we've lost two runners on our team of 8 for the upcoming Ragnar Trail race at Anne Springs Close on October 7/8. We're a fun (well, I think so at least) mixed gender group. We're not a competitive team, so your pace time isn't too important.

hello, I am trying to understand if I'm being taken for a ride here. was quoted an removal and install for 85 Sq ft of flooring in the estimate. however only 32 Sq ft was taken out and reinstalled. the contractor is trying to tell me it's per job not per square ft. so basically the cost would be the same if I installed 85 Sq ft or 150 or 32. I'm told all contractors charge per job because they are so busy now. also, the flooring guys were here for 2 hrs total.

We deeply apologize if we couldnâ€™t get you a free sample, we learned a lot in our first small batch run. If youâ€™re a fan of the hot sauce, snag an Early Bird Special!&nbsp;**The Trini Pepper Sauce Taste and Background**For those who are not familiar with the hot sauce, itâ€™s called Trini Pepper Sauce, and is a recipe from my family thatâ€™s been passed down from five generations. Every time I took a trip back to Trinidad and Tobago, my grandmother would send hot sauce back with me to share with my friends and family. The hot sauce blends fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs with mustard and vinegar, creating a rich, delicious flavor. The Scotch Bonnet Peppers give the sauce a glowing yellow color. The result is a unique tasting, incredibly flavorful sauce that's so fresh and unprocessed you'll savor each and every ingredient! &nbsp;**To get the sauce**Please visit our Kickstarter page and check out the video and different backing levels.

I moved here about two months ago. I honestly don't have any friends here and dating has always been a comfortable way of meeting people for me. I'm interested in something long term but I wouldn't mind short term either. I've always used OKC in the past but was having very little luck on there finding guys I would be interested in. I prefer the interface of Bumble and the whole girl messages first thing I'm into, but I'm not having great luck with actually getting dates from there. I'm into Midwestern guys with dad bods, big heart, and bigger brains, Bumble seems to be mostly former frat types. I haven't tried tinder here. What do you guys think is the most active dating app here?

"Hi my name is Bruce (30/m) and I just moved to the Charlotte area from northern Indiana with my girlfriend. Due to our jobs and trying to get situated, it's been pretty difficult finding people that have similar interests. It seems like it might be difficult to find a social outlet to plug into. I'm a former skateboarder (I still skate but not even close to the same level because of age/past injuries/fat), big time into music (live shows, festivals, I play guitar) pretty hardcore gamer with a pretty extensive collection (if you want to jam out on the classics or PC, I'm your dude). As a couple we dig new beers, new food, thrifting, interesting places to check out and explore. My girlfriend digs horror/thriller novels, bookstores, coffee shops, thrifting. For a relatively young couple, this place seems really rad but we are open to suggestions on new stuff."
"What's up guys! A friend of mine told me that I should hang out around The Rabbit Hole to try and find a new bassist. Unfortunately, I only see one show on their website which is on the 27th of September.What gives? Are there shows every Friday/Saturday that aren't listed on their website?"


So I haven't found places that rent sports cars or classic cars.  I basically need one for an event.

Do you guys have any suggestions?

So I have been applying for a position as a health services researcher at CHS. I have several years of research experience, great recommendations, and writing samples. I have applied through the website several times. Every time I apply, it says my application is under review, but I never hear anything. The job has also been relisted at least three time. It is quite disheartening. Working as a health services researcher is literally my dream job and I cannot score an interview for some reason. I am not from NC, so I don't have any connections at CHS. Any advice on getting an interview?

"Every day here on our sub has a particular ""theme"". Moderator Monday, Tirade Tuesday, etc... Well, I had a very good experience at a barber shop this morning, and when they asked me ""how did you hear about us"", I said that I'm a redditor, and a few local people had mentioned the place on this particular sub as an answer to ""where to get a good men's haircut/beard trim"".This got me to thinking, so bear with me... Sunday, on this subreddit, does not have a ""theme"". What if we were to make it a ""Shout-Out Sunday""? If you've had a good experience with a local business, let the masses know. It could be the anti Tirade Tuesday, and being Sunday, showing so much love for local places might put people off on the right start to their week with a smile,  and a ""hey, right on, I'll check that place out today!"" Anyway, it's just something that poped in my little thought noodles after I left the barber shop totally happy and satisfied!

"Hi all, My girlfriend and I are both Floridians who moved to NYC earlier this year.  Suffice to say...it sucks.  The commute is awful, people are miserable, etc.  So, I've been thinking about moving to somewhere more mountainous - Asheville is wonderful, but I work in finance and my girlfriend is in medicine, so Charlotte or Raleigh were the main options.  We drove down over the weekend to scope places out.  At any rate, being the piedmont, I knew it wasn't going to mountainous, but it seemed relatively flat in a lot of parts.  We drove to the Spencer Mountain/Lowell area, and it seemed like that was much more in line with where I'd like to get 5-10 acres (maybe more, if it were a farm for sale or something).  I plan on renting for the first year or so anyway, as we acclimate to the area.  I can accept that piedmont != soaring mountain views, but I'd like breathing room and more nature than what I saw in the subdivisions with 1/4 acre plots.  Thoughts?"

"So I've lived in Charlotte for less than a year.  I work far outside of the city and subsequently haven't had much of a chance to socialize or make friends in the area.  I moved here with my girlfriend of 9 years and as of Monday I am now single.  I wouldn't say it's been a nasty breakup, we've just become two different people over time and it was finally time for both of us to move on.  Be that as it may, the past week has been absolutely miserable.I hate posting a sob story on Reddit, but as you can imagine, suddenly not being with someone after 9 years has been difficult.  We're still living together (probably not the best idea, I know, but it's only temporary).  She's gone on a trip for the weekend, and I'd rather not sit at our apartment alone.  If anyone has any ideas on anything to do around here that would take my mind off of things I'd truly appreciate it."

Hello! I am in the process of relocating from Louisville, KY to the Charlotte area. I have two little ones who will be in elementary school.  Can anyone recommend any areas to live that have great schools and are family friendly. I have relatives who live in the Concord area not too far from Concord Mall, and I am considering moving there, but I wanted to get your opinions.  Our kids do well in school and are pretty active (ballet, karate, etc). We don't want to have to drive 30+ minutes every time we take them to a class. We don't want to live out in the wooded, isolated areas, because I scare easily and I hate bugs.  Our budget for a home is about 250k.  We are an ethnically diverse family and would like our girls to attend a diverse school.  Any feedback or suggestions you have would be great.

"Hi, my wife and I moved up here from Baton Rouge last year and are going down in October. We've been taking some donations and it looks like we're going to have to rent a box truck due to the generous people in and around Huntersville. I figured since we're already getting a truck, we might as well open this thing up and see what we can do!We are not really accepting food, diapers, etc. that would be addressed by the time October comes around. Instead, we are looking for things that would need to be replaced in homes after they've been cleaned up. Here's a brief list:Gently used furnitureKitchen appliances (toasters, blenders, knife sets, etc.)Larger appliances (we already have a fridge and a freezer!)Clothes, shoes, etc.Winter Coats (especially for kids)TowelsSheets and linensRugs of all typesStuffed animalsBooks of all types (my mother is a librarian and is distributing books to appropriate outlets based on content)ArtAnything else that you think people wouldn't be replacing right away, but would really help people as they put their lives back together.If you have some stuff you've been looking to take to Goodwill, please consider sending it directly to those in need. We are not going through an organization in order to avoid red tape, opting to just bring it directly to families in need and hand them whatever we have out of the back of the truck. Hoever, we will be documenting throughout the trip with pictures and stories. If there is interest, I'll post all of that documentation here so you know it's actually helping people.*I realize I just created this account and this could seem fishy. This is my very first post, but I'm a long time lurker. If we meet to collect any donations I will gladly prove that I am not running a scam here. I still have my LA ID (w/ my BR address) and will give you my direct contact information so you can verify who I am and that I'm actually giving all this stuff directly to people who really need it.Thanks!"

I just finished voting at the Library Uptown, E. 6th St. between N. College and N. Tryon (right in front of Discovery Place) and there was no line! It took 20 minutes from the time I was walking in to when I was already outside, and that's because I had to register. Please go vote! Take 20 minutes (10 if you are already registered!) to go and decide which direction your country gets tilted to during the next few years!

Are there any groups fighting against and/or raising awareness of climate change in the Queen City?

"I went to the renaissance festival yesterday and anywhere anyone was sitting with food, there were dozens of yellow jackets (or some sort of bee?).  Every show's seating had them, as long as people were eating.  Having said that, do not panic.  One got in my beer (glad I checked before swallowing that) but otherwise they seemed harmless.  They are after the food, and especially the breadbowls and turkey legs.   Once those are removed from the area (like when a family runs off scared for their life), everything was quite enjoyable.   Also, they never seemed to bother me with food in hand while walking.tl;dr:  Yellow Jackets have overrun the festival but as long as you aren't sitting around a family of 10 eating, you won't really bothered.Edit: a bit of clarity, I consider the yellow jackets to be more on par with flies, at least the way they acted.  Maybe a bit more determined, but I didn't have any bites or stings.  Having said that, Yellow Jackets are notoriously aggressive, but given the amount of people I saw swating at them, these guys are basically house trained for food. :-)"

"So, I am really considering going to scarowinds tonight or tomorrow night and buying the fastpass.  If I got it, how realistically long of the line would the wait be?  I realize it says ""get to the front of the line"", but if everyone gets a pass then that is just another line (but a quicker one).  Also, how much would it be to get to scarowinds tickets with fast passes for two people?  Also, would these have to be bought at the door, or be bought online?  I'm guessing they have to bump the price up.Last, if I showed up at 8pm with a fast pass, could I realistically get through all the coasters easily?

"Hello all,A little over a year ago a Director and VP of my company approached me for a project. The project had me working some pretty crazy shifts, so they offered in that time to give me a bonus in the form of a shift allowance. Before agreeing I negotiated this to be a permanent increase that, I thought I deserved based on my good work, they agreed.A few months later and the project is successfully over, but the raise on my paystubs is still showing as an shift allowance bonus. I inform my direct manager and the director, who in turn says they with contact the VP and HR to get the issue fixed.....This happens multiple times. Unfortunately in the following couple months both the Director and VP involved are no longer with the company.Fast forward to this week...The new director sits me down to inform me that the bonus was set to end after a year and that my next check (which I get tomorrow) would not have the money. I inform him that it was supposed to be a permanent raise and we argue for a bit. I remember the previous director sent me an email stating that he and the previous VP agreed that it would indeed be a permanent increase. I tell the new director and forward him the email, which he tells me is generic. He forwards this on to the new VP who apparently forwards this to HR.I am able to view my paystub for my upcoming check today and the money is gone. I am hoping they tell me they are going to cut me a check for the difference and going forward my check should be fixed, but I have a feeling they are going to tell me to fuck off.In all honesty its not a ton of money...after tax and insurance it only equals a couple hundred bucks per check, but I have kids 1 being autistic and we are a paycheck to paycheck family, so that extra bit of money is groceries.Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thank you!EDIT: After trying to figure out from my boss what is going on with my raise...i was just fired via cellphoneEDIT: Anyone know a good lawyer??? "

Anyone have any leads?Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions. I have been to about half the locations listed so far. I found frozen partial squid meat in many locations. (Suckers or tentacle tips for example) I also found whole non-frozen squid at the International Market on Sugar Creek and Tryon, but the wife was very dubious of how long they may have been sitting there. I thought that they looked fine (and were probably American caught squid which is bluish) but the color was not right to what she was expecting from squid she's used to (Thai caught squid which is very pale white) so she didn't want to take the chance. We ended up buying some frozen squid parts and will try the other half of the suggestions next time.Thanks for all the suggestions folks."

"I'm a New York native currently interviewing for a position in Charlotte, and I've started to take a serious look at apartments in the surrounding area. Since I'd rather not live within the city limits, I've been looking at renting in either Mooresville or Huntersville, and have found two very nice, affordable apartments in both. That being said, I do have some questions about where I should choose to settle down in.The position I'm interviewing for directly involves auto racing, my industry of choice, and I know that the hub of that business is in Mooresville. I also understand that relative to Huntersville, Mooresville has more stuff going on in general. However, the company I'm interviewing with is located right in uptown Charlotte, and I understand that traffic going from Charlotte to Mooresville on I-77 is an absolute disaster (Though I will say that, having driven on both, I-77 isn't nearly as bad as the horror show that are roads in New York's Hudson Valley). As such, I was looking at Huntersville on the basis that my commute might be easier.I currently work an office job in NYC and don't have the luxury of checking for myself, but for my purposes, which town do you think is best for me? The apartments I'm looking at are equally nice and within my price point, so things like traffic/retail/safety are really what my decision boils down to.Thanks."

"Hi, r/charlotte. Today I was running late for work due to some traffic on 77 south. I was going about 80 on the SC side of 77 (speed limit is 60) - definitely fast although I am often passed on that road by people going way above that. Seemingly out of nowhere, some guy wearing a bright yellow uniform-looking shirt sped up super quickly until he was driving parallel to me with one lane between us. I look over at him and he's looking right at me! Then he starts texting, and I think it's a little strange. I've slowed down a ton at this point because he scared the heck outta me. Then he starts (seemingly) recording me on his phone while talking into a little headpiece and moves over so that he's driving behind me then beside me on the other side of my car before he slowly passes me. He looked like he was recording me on his phone the entire time.What the heck?! Is this something I should be worried about? I know I was speeding, but I don't think I did anything that should have pissed that guy off. What do y'all think?"

I recently moved across town and needed to change my registration to my new address. I mailed in my form and actually forgot I was even expecting to get a new card. My dad called me yesterday and said Mecklenburg County sent my voter registration card and info to his house. I have no idea why this would have happened since I haven't lived there in over two years, and the address is in New York. The registration card has the New York address on it, but tells me where my voter location is in Charlotte. This makes no sense since I registered with my new address. No where on my registration form did I put my old NY address, so it's a mystery as to why it was sent up there. Anyway, if you mailed your registration forms in and still haven't gotten your voter card, try to see if they sent it to an old address.

Hey there /r/Charlotte! It's almost time for this week's brewery meetup.

If there is a beer you've wanted to try, even from a brewery as far away as Asheville to the west or Kinston in the east, there's a good chance you can find it at Flight! A great place for someone new to beer to try to find something that interests them in this great world of beer, Flight supplements it's great beer selection with a [delicious menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) that I have yet to find anything I don't like on! On a side note, if anyone has a brewery they would like for us to add to the rotation (I believe we hit the major ones in the area open on Tuesday's) don't hesitate to shoot me a PM! Hope we can see you all there!
"Hey all, I'm just wondering what areas I should look into for buying a house next year? I am 28, no kids, will have one pet, and looking to get my first home. My budget is $200k and I don't need a huge house, 1500 sq ft maximum would suit me fine. If I can get it, I would like a decent back yard, good schools around and just a good, safe area for younger professionals. I would also prefer to stay South of Uptown if at all possible.I've been told Cotswold and Elizabeth would be good spots, but I know my budget might be stretched in Elizabeth. I work off N Tryon St, so I would prefer to be within 20 minutes of the city. Pineville wouldn't work for me just because of the commute, although at the moment I work 230-1130pm, so maybe traffic is not all that bad with that schedule, but my schedule could change in the future.Any recommendations are welcome and I am happy to provide more details if I haven't given enough. Thanks in advance.UPDATE: Sorry, I should have said no town homes or anything like that. I refuse to follow rules, regulations, etc. because of a recent bad experience in an apartment."

"I've been telling myself I'd post something like this to give back to the /r/charlotte community ever since my global entry application went through, so here's my experience:**Some Details**To those unfamiliar with the program, global entry is the international version of TSA pre-check, which includes domestic TSA pre-check benefits. It basically means you can leave your shoes on, your laptop in your bag, your toiletries in your suitcase but most importantly you can get access into a super-short security line at the airport for both international and domestic flights (TSA Pre-check is just domestic flights).I travel a pretty minor amount (6 weeks a year for work, maybe 2 weeks a year for personal travel) and have heard about the benefits of TSA Pre-check but have never looked into it. I heard that Global Entry INCLUDES TSA Pre-check but for only $15 more.  (At time of this writing TSA pre-check is $85, Global Entry is $100.) I signed up and finally got it but here's what went down. **What I Didn't Know**: Despite Global Entry INCLUDING TSA pre-check, the difference is that when your Global Entry application is approved, I was completely unable to schedule an appointment with TSA (to basically be fingerprinted and have your identity checked). There are only so many available appointments with the TSA at the airport and there were ZERO available appointments in the next six months. This information was available to me only AFTER I paid a non-refundable $100 global entry application fee. Knowing this was complete BS I called the global entry office at the CLT Douglas Airport. The woman told me to check the website ""up to five times a day"" looking for appointment cancellations. I asked about walk-ins -- she advised me that their office accepts walk-ins Mondays and Fridays only. She also told me to ""be prepared to wait all day"" and ""accept the reality that I may not be seen that day"". Not wanting to take a day off of work, and knowing that was complete BS, I signed up for TSA pre-check (which one can easily get an appointment for several weeks out at MANY locations around Charlotte). **What Ended Up Happening**I was flying back through CLT on an odd Monday so I thought I'd bring my documents with me (passport + proof of residency). It turns out that the walk-in line at around 2pm on a Monday was COMPLETELY EMPTY and I WALKED RIGHT IN. The appointment took about 15 minutes and most of that was two TSA agents BSing with each other about PTO. Gotta love the government. I wanted to share my experience in hopes that it helps someone else. Basically the takeaways are:* If you don't do much international travel, it is way, way, WAY easier and $15 cheaper to just sign up for TSA Pre-Check* If you do a little international travel, and want to take your chances, try the global entry office walk-in around 2pm on a Monday (keep in mind this is a sample size of 1)I hope this helps at least one person out there. Safe travels, /r/charlotte! "
"Okay, so I don't usually write long-winded reviews like this of local businesses, but this place irked me so much that I felt like I had to, to warn others to beware. Also, let me state that this was late at night, so maybe I'm not being fair to Moosehead Grill. If I went during the day, perhaps it might be better. The way I was treated will keep me far away for some time. Anyway, here we go.Far and away, this is the worst burger joint/bar I've been to in Charlotte. I went there on a Saturday night, so granted, the place was a bit roudy. No problem. The issue started when I tried to order food and a beer. The bartender was busy and I did not see a waitress. I knew they had food, so I got one of the Chef's attention. Right away, I knew this guy was on something, because he didn't seem to acknowledge what I was saying. I began by asking for a recommendation of food, to which he offered a few choices (no menu to speak of), then became frustrated for unknown reasons, asking me several times if I want the tacos or the fajitas. I kept saying 'Fajitas' in vain. He then told me I could eat on the upper deck (a request I had made earlier) and that a waitress would come up. Then, he proceeded to ask if I had any friends joining me. I said: ""Yes, one"", to which he said: ""Is your friend a faggot?"" I didn't know what to say at this point. He also asked me if I was afraid of black people, to which I said ""No, not at all."" After this, he brings me out past the bar, tells me to hold on and shoots down a fireball shot provided by one of the drunks at the bar. Then, he brings me into the kitchen where the chefs are preparing food, and he continues rambling on and asking me bizarre questions, introducing me to some of the guys working who looked inebriated as well. There was a female waiter just standing there as we passed, and when he asked her if she could serve me, she said ""I'm done."" I took this as her shift being up, but I figured out later she was still working. Go figure. So, after asking for the fajitas, the Chef made me a salad (didn't wash his hands) and that was that. No taking down my order or acknowledging that he would make the fajitas. I ended up sitting at one of the booths, eating the salad while the staff walked back and forth, ignoring me as I tried to get their attention and order a beer. I guess if you want to be served here, go and stay at the bar until you get what you need. Otherwise, you're SOL. Perhaps my mistake was going to the chef instead of the bartender. Silly me. Anyway, I swiftly left the place and they will never see my business again for a long time. I'm sure they won't mind. To close, I don't care if it's 4pm or midnight, you do not treat customers like that, and saying ""Oh, it's a dive bar"" is no excuse. Rant over. "

I mention this because they seem to NOT exist here in Charlotte [or I haven't found one]).So, with that said, what are some good alternatives for people in their 20s to enjoy themselves without going deaf from blaring noise from overcrowding noisy places or places with loud blaring music on Halloween?  I am sort of at a loss of ideas, but maybe I'm just not thinking hard enough.  Any one have any suggestions on something fun to do around here?  PS:  I'm fine with bars too if the noise levels stay low.  Again, I can't emphasize who much I despise blaring loud music or overcrowded loud places where you have to yell to have a basic conversation with someone."

When you buy a scratch off tickets at any of the lottery kiosks around town, usually in grocery stores, you have to scan your drivers license too I assume verify your age and if you are legally old enough to purchase the ticket. Does anyone know what else they use that scanned information for? From the scan, they now have my name and address, can they track what tickets and the cost of those tickets I personally buy? Can they track my winnings? 
"I'm hosting my little sister's bridal shower and I have no idea what to do.She is really easy going and would be cool with most locations, I just want to make sure she has a great time and that I don't let her down.She loves sushi, or coffee, or tea, or desserts, or almost anything so the options are pretty open. The guest list is going to be around 25 or so, I think.I already looked at Amelie's, and they are out of their minds on pricing. I'm hoping to not break the bank on this...i don't know my budget, but I know Amelie's was out of it ($150/hour for a room with a 2 hour minimum, and a $200 minimum food purchase required on top of that.

"[Article up on the Observer](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/development/article105907107.html)Interesting idea but personally I am not sure mandating units in **every** new development is the right way to go.  Some developments sure but it's not reasonable for all projects. I think Charlotte would be best served if they offered developers the ability to pay affordable housing development fee, that's a % of the project budget, as an alternative to affordable units.  This in turn would create a slush fund that could be used to develop affordable housing projects for both low and mid-level incomes.  "

"Greetings from the Atl y'all! This came out back in Dec. 2015 (almost a year ago now), but I didn't see it posted here (even after searching), and felt that y'all would like to see it.Basically, this is the Tier I Environmental Impact Study for the Atlanta to Charlotte section of the [Southeast Corridor](http://www.sehsr.org/). It breaks down the final routing options, operating and construction costs, and even what operation schedules would look like.It won't be cheap, but it's not at all infeasible to get done, and I know that there are plenty of us down in Atlanta who would love to get it done. Anyway, enjoy the reading material, and here's hoping our two lovely cities can be connected by something a little better than just the Crescent![LINK TO STUDY](http://www.dot.ga.gov/InvestSmart/Rail/Documents/Atl-Char/AtltoCharPRCIPAlternativesDevelopmentReport.pdf)"

"Hey there everyone! I hope everyone's week has started out well, it's time for another brewery meetup! This week we will be heading to [NoDa Brewing](http://nodabrewing.com/home/) (the N.

"Figured it was worth bringing attention to - we've been without rain for... a while now. Sky's grey, we're expecting a few days of nonstop rain (and likely some flooding in a few areas as a result), and on the bright side, we'll finally get some water.However, that being said? Do **NOT** drive for a few hours once this impending downpour begins. The roads have had a while to accrue oils and muck on them, and without a regular washout to handle it, it has gotten nasty. They'll dislodge, effectively coat the roads in a slick gloss, and put you at risk. Expect wrecks on highways and prominent delays as a direct result. If you have a short commute, you'll likely be fine (especially if you don't have to take any high-traffic routes), but if you're able to work from home or just hang around your workplace for a bit once the downpour starts, that might be a better option than risking it.Update: I get it guys, this is common sense to a lot of folks. I figured it worth bringing up because it gets worse the longer we go without any rainfall, and I've lived here my whole life (sans a 2 year gap about four years ago), and never seen it go this long without a drop."

"I don't know if anyone here is particularly familiar with AC repair or the costs associated with having it fixed but last week I had a hedge trimmer come out to cut our patio's bushes. The guy cut into the copper line running into the unit. I had the AC turned off at the time but I saw a lot of freon come out. I finally bit the bullet and had a repair company come by today and they quoted me $730 for the entire repair because of the cost of R-22 refrigerant and labor. I know this is an oddly specific question but does that seem like a high rate or am I just naive? I did not expect this to be as costly as it is but the other competitors have been slow in responding with a comparable quote. Any insight/past experience would be much appreciated!"

"Hey there!I am a 23-year old male living alone in Rock Hill and I adopted a dog from the Humane Society a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, my allergies have become way more significant with my Asthma than I originally estimated and I am looking at having to give her up next week and return her to the Humane Society because of my own health. I have checked with the Humane Society and it's fine if I give her to a different owner, I just have to let them know.I'm her third owner and she is an amazing dog. I would hate for her to be stuck in a kennel again looking for a new home. She is a 2-year old Australian Kelpie (I think there is a little bit of Lab in her). She is around 40 lbs. and stands about knee height. The first owner gave her up because they moved to house that doesn't allow pets and the second gave her up because the dog was too energetic for their full family. She is House-trained and knows basic commands, though has trouble listening when really hyper. She will play fetch, but will play keep away when she comes back with the object. She is very smart though and I have begun clicker training with her already to better cement some things. She has one bite on her record from her last owner, and that was because they tried to shove her off a bed. You'd probably snap too if someone grabbed you when/how you didn't want to be grabbed. She is super sweet and I haven't noticed any aggressive behavior around people (I live in an apartment). I was able to replicate the bite scenario artificially and it is very simple to avoid, so it's nothing to be worried about. I am looking for a home for her. If I can't find one by next week, I will have to return her. I have a dog bed, a food container, scoop, collar, front-clip harness, collar, toys, and treats.  She is a very active dog and I usually take her to a dog park every evening for an hour or two to run around. She is also chipped.If you are looking to adopt a dog, I would be willing to give her up to a loving home and give everything I've bought for her as well. I spent about $400 getting her settled in with everything, the only thing I don't have yet for her are medications (heartworm, fleas, etc.). So you could look at saving a significant amount of money if you adopt from me. I'm not looking to give her to just anyone. I definitely want to make sure she goes to a good home. So if you are interested, please PM me for more info.http://imgur.com/a/l8yaBI checked the sidebar and didn't see any rules against this type of post, but if it is violating any rules, I'm sorry!

We're supposed to go have dinner at my in-laws tomorrow, however I seem to have come down with a pretty bad cold in the last 24 hours. My father-in-law has a compromised immune system, so we can't head over there for fear that I'll get him sick. I've been checking around places like Harris Teeter and Publix but they require reservations for their Thanksgiving dinner meals that you can purchase. Anywhere where you can just grab and go without having to reserve one in advance?
I've had a hard time meeting people. Even the couple of people I know aren't being super reliable. So trying to have a better group of friends. Tips appreciated. I literally knew like 2-3 people and that's it.

"Pre tl:dr - Looking to place dog on death row to single-pet household.Our black and white Great Dane/lab (?) mix Loki is displaying signs of aggression toward our Shar Pei mix Ladida.  We're certain it's because she just lost her best friend, a 13-year old Pitt named Cashious.  On Sunday, Loki started a fight with her. She did not bite her, but pinned her to the ground and pulled her collar, getting her jaw stuck underneath and almost strangling Ladida. It was quite scary and we felt it was best to have Animal Control remove her from our home lest the behavior escalates.I hate to preface this request with that story, but we want to be honest and factual about her situation. With people, she is perfect, and there hasn't been an issue with other dogs until recently. Unfortunately, we received a call from Animal Control to let us know that she would be put down, which we absolutely can not abide. This dog is amazingly sweet and caring. She doesn't deserve that.What we are asking is that if you, or anyone you know, is interested in a larger dog for a single-pet household, to please contact me as soon as humanly possible. Let me know if you have any questions, or write privately if you know of anyone who is interested.  We've tried the Great Dane Rescue and they are full. Thank you so much!!!If this is an inappropriate place to post this, just let me know where is best.Photos of Loki: http://imgur.com/a/yc2xb"

"Hey, this is actually my first reddit post ever.-m 22-was living in europe for 5 years finishing highschool and tried university there (i flunked out and had to move back to the US with my parents once my dads job term in EU was finished)So basically I'm attending CPCC right now and the social atmosphere at this place is dismal...0 friends and one or two acquaintances. I've got minimum until this summer at the school and then I will transfer to a bigger college. (obviously this will help loads in the whole friend making/activities thing)  I live out in waxhaw and i'm still in my parents house which makes social interaction even worse...I'm finding it extremely difficult right now and i'm basically all on my own. I've also just come out of a really serious relationship with a girl in europe (i wont go into detail but we split on good terms because of the distance, shes now seeing someone else and im devastated, everything is up in the air and nothing is certain) and its an exceptionally difficult time for me right now and I'm pretty much reaching out to try and get myself in a better place and to establish a group of friends to keep me preoccupied and give me a more tolerable life here.So, I love belgian beer (i suppose i'm hinting that craft beer might be a thing but i havent tried much yet), partying and getting drunk with friends. I'm very fond of underground raves and techno music. Clubs and commercial electronic music shows are also ok but i'd probably say i'm not a huge fan of a lot of mainstream EDM and all that. I even make some music myself. I suppose i have a bit of a hipster attitude but i'm not into art exhibits or weird social justice activism or any of that nonsense. I've just recently since moving back, got into driving (europe 18 to drive but you pretty much dont need to b/c of awesome public transport), and i dont really know my way around. I hate football and sports bar type things and I detest most of that fratty style stuff. I feel really disconnected because of the cultural differences and ways people do things here. Its not like I can go get wasted and walk the streets bar hopping/going to techno parties with friends and walk home. Also charlotte seems pretty unsafe to me.I just want to get out and do things and make connections with people here but heading into this all alone with no real guidance is pretty difficult, especially in the place/state im at right now.So if you can give me any advice, tips, places to go, things to try or if you want to reach out to me I would be eternally grateful. :)"
"Since all the news seems to have their own slant, I thought I would post a couple notes on where this race actually is at without opinion.**Current Vote Count:**  - Cooper leads McCrory by 4,900 votes with 58,000 provisional and absentee ballots yet to be counted.    - Cooper has increased his lead from 4,100 since they began counting these ballots.    - All votes are scheduled to be counted and complete by Friday 11/18/16.    **Disputes**  - There was an error with six databases of early votes from Durham County on election night.  These databases could not be loaded properly to record the voting data.  - Due to the error, over 90,000 votes we hand counted.    - Before those 90,000 votes were counted and submitted, McCrory had a lead of 60,000 votes.  After, he was trailing by 2,500 votes.    - The North Carolina Republican Party has filed a formal complaint asking for a hand-recount in Durham County.   - The county board voted (2-1 in favor of) to have a hearing on Friday to determine if a recount should happen.       **Additional Information:**  - According to state law, if the difference in total votes is less than 10,000 once all counties are confirmed, either candidate may ask for a complete recount.  - If that happens, a recount will not likely occur until after Thanksgiving according to multiple news reports.      If I made any mistakes please let me know and I will make edits as necessary.  Thanks!"

Hey there /r/charlotte! Getting the post up earlier than usual this week! Look at me being a responsible host and everything! By popular demand this week we will be heading out to [Flight Beer Garden and Music Hall](http://flightclt.com/). Home of the [largest selection](http://flightclt.com/beers-on-tap/) of any of our normal cycle, Flight gives the opportunity to try beers not only from the greater Charlotte area, but also into the mountains, the Research Triangle, and beyond. Tuesday is also Flight's 22oz night, getting you a 22oz beer for the price of a 16oz, and free beer is always a reason to be happy! To go with the great beer and to prevent anyone from having too much to drink on an empty stomach, Flight has my [favorite menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) on our meetup cycle. So come on out on Tuesday for great (somewhat free) beer, great food, and great company! Hope to see you all there!

Hey future neighbors! My fiancÃ© and I will be moving to Charlotte in Late Spring/Early Summer 2017.

We'd still like to stay in a nice hotel and be able to do some fun things while we're there, so I'm looking for suggestions. Of course Downtown is always an obvious choice to look, but I was wondering if there are specific areas of Charlotte that I should be exploring. Thanks for y'all's help!

This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

"OK, so I live in the University Area with my husband and 4 children. We have a 4,000 sq ft house that we bought 10 years ago that has 2 apartments in the basement. It is about 1/4 mile from the light rail line at UCB. My mom lived in one of them and my brother-in-law lived in the other, but both of them passed away. I promise, the house is not haunted! We have gutted one of the apartments in order to remodel it, but neither my husband or I have the time or cash to go down there and fix it up. This one is a studio (it did have a bedroom, but we removed all the walls to make it a studio). The other side is a one bedroom that is partially finished. Both sides have private bathrooms and connections for kitchens, but no kitchens installed.I had an idea that maybe we could find someone who would be willing to fix up the apartments in exchange for living there for free. We could negotiate the terms to be good for you and for us. I was thinking something like a year of rent free living in exchange for remodeling the apartments. You would have to pay for supplies, but you won't be paying rent, so I think this is fair. The ideal person would have to be very flexible, as we have 4 kids that are loud and ridiculous. I would have a serious problem living with someone who I didn't trust around my kids. We also have 4 dogs and 3 cats, but they stay completely in the upstairs part of the house. Basically, the house is a blank slate that we would really like to fix up, we are just too busy to do it. Let me know if you are interested in something like this. I know it sounds a little crazy, but I thought there might be someone who needs a place to stay that is good with their hands and could use a leg up in life."

I'm usually pretty good at planning dates (or so I'm told) but this one was a bit tougher - my date is under 21. So for Friday, the kind of ""focal point"" of the date was the Bobby Lee stand up show at The Comedy Zone. The show has been canceled, so now I'm looking at finding another under-21 friendly thing to do. I've got a couple little things we're doing that let us talk, of course, but I like to find something fun that's a little more outside the norm (at least for my date).Some ideas I had but can't seem to find specifics on are:1. Live music in a setting where we can talk, like a coffee shop or low-key 18+ bar. Something low key and fairly intimate, not like a concert type deal. Are Tin Roof and The Evening Muse (and anything similar in uptown/NoDa/Plaza Midwood) 18+ before it gets late? What other such places are there?2. Cool local happenings. Think art show, or a local flavor type event. For example, there are places where I'm from that do huge Christmas light displays. I know Things to do Thursday will help, but I don't like to be last minute with stuff.Thanks!"

"Hey everyone,I'm a 26 year old web developer, who works from home. Me and my girlfriend moved up to Charlotte early this year and were there for about 2 months. We ended up coming back down to Florida after a combination of family and personal issues. During our time there we really didn't get out and see much. Since we both work from home making friends was pretty tough, and we also didn't get out in the city at all. The close proximity to hiking and the mountains was a huge plus, though.Anyway, once our lease on this place is up we're thinking of moving back. Florida really doesn't have much to offer us and we miss the weather and landscape so much. However, we're a bit both cautious that we might not meet people or branch out at all. Do you have any recommendations as to what we could do to meet some like-minded people our age?

"Earlier this year, I acquired health insurance for the first time in years! I made the plunge and set up an appointment with a doctor that had good reviews and a recommendation from someone from another thread.Though I have a few things that I would like to work on, I would like to primarily focus on my ADHD. I was prescribed Vyvanse in my early 20's (I'm 28 now) and was lucky enough to have it for several months before losing my insurance. It was a night/day difference on how it helped me function.I've had a desk job for the past 2 years and it's driving me bananas. I've learned a lot of great coping mechanisms through the years that help combat my attention problems and social anxiety but just because I'm 'doing rather well' doesn't mean it's not a struggle. Being productive and organized keeps me in good spirits.I mentioned how my desk job has caused some increased difficulties with my ADHD and how my previous prescription to Vyvanse helped with these types of difficulties in the past to my new doctor. While she seemed understanding, she only felt comfortable recommending me to a psychiatrist to get re-diagnosed with ADHD. (And to talk about my depression, anxiety, weirdness')I'm only a month into a four month wait for the one she deemed appropriate (and that is just for the first appointment, which may add even more time to my timeline); I'm trying to be patient but with this past week being a terror at work, I'm making this thread. Without Vyvanse or anything to help with the difficulties caused by my ADHD, I often get distracted and have trouble staying on task for the things I need to do and that cuts into my productivity/organization/happiness/self-esteem.So, I'm looking for recommendations on a doctor - one who will basically prescribe me Vyvanse (or similar) without having to go through a psychological exam.Thank you so much."
"Hey everyone. My name is Michael. My family and I are moving to Charlotte from Hampton Roads (Virginia Beach, VA) late March 2017.

"Hey r/Charlotte fam! I am looking for a rave to bring in the New Year! I don't know much about clubs and venues in the area so I was wondering what y'all are doing or what's going on. I tried to do a little research but there were a lot of options and I was super overwhelmed. I'm planning on doing MDMA, so that's the type of vibe I am going for. Thanks so much."
Happy Holidays /r/Charlotte! I hope everyone had a great Christmas, is having a great Chanukah, or is generally enjoying their holiday! For the final meetup of 2016 we'll be heading to [Birdsong Brewing](https://birdsongbrewing.com/)! Perhaps best known for their Jalapeno Pale Ale, Birdsong has probably the [widest variety of ales](https://birdsongbrewing.com/beers/) on the meetup rotation. And don't worry, for those hop-adverse among you, Birdsong also makes some excellent wheats and dark beers (I love their Mexi-Cali Stout!). Birdsong is currently slated to host [Now Toasted Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/NowToasted/about/) on Tuesday, but if they don't sound up to your liking, we will be right around central NoDa for some great food! I hope we can see you all there to finish out the year!

This is one of the things I am trying to check, and I can't seem to find any resources to do this.My last option may be to file a missing persons report, but I feel like I shouldn't have to do that, if someone from the parole office would just talk to us. What should I do? We would like to see him for Christmas, and more importantly, we want to know he is okay.Edit: Thank you everyone. We found him. Some of the state websites I had previously checked were not up to date. Apparently he violated parole. Thanks again for everyone's help and suggestions. "

My fiance and I are looking for extremely affordable wedding reception ideas for our DIY wedding that we are trying to keep below 5k. We are considering local park venues, etc. but are having difficulty finding one big enough for the 150-200 people we are hoping to invite, and most of the park websites have very limited information and pictures. We have a lot of friends that are helping out with vendor related items so if we can find a location that is less than a thousand dollars we should be able to stay within budget. Our date is flexible (we are doing a courthouse ceremony in August, so sometime after then) and within an hour or so drive of Charlotte. Must haves are really just price, size accommodation, and must allow alcohol. =) Any ideas will be greatly appreciated!

A good example would be Second harvest food bank which seems to be quite popular for the younger crowd (already filled up on the weekends into middle of next year). So my question is what are some good volunteer opportunities that not only allow the chance to make a difference in the community, but to also meet people who also volunteer that are between 20-30 years of age. Thanks
I just purchased a new watch and am looking for 24mm watch bands. I've seen quite a few on Etsy but was wondering if there are any suggestions for leather shops or someone local that makes leather straps. Any thoughts?

"Hey guys. Wondering if anyone has any recommendations for an eye exam on the cheap for a currently unemployed with no health insurance individual? I've googled for free options and, while they do exist, they seem to be hard to get in to without working with a charity or social worker.Doesn't have to be 100% free. I could probably scrounge up $50-$100 if necessary. But cheaper would be better. Just a routine exam. I haven't had one in 10 years or so and there are some things I'm worried about. Somewhere near South Charlotte/Fort Mill/Rock Hill.Thanks for any input you may have."
"An update from this post Lost & Found Stolen Scooter Sharon South BOTLO Please!http://reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/5dniwz/stolen_scooter_sharon_south_botlo_please/?ref=search_posts we got a call from three boys that said that they purchased our stolen scooter. We met them and waited on police to get there. These boys had a picture of the guys license, his name and address where they met him. Also, they said there were several other mopeds and laptops he was trying to sell them. The picture matched the same guy I saw the day before creeping around behind the buildings. Anyway, there have been numerous break ins within a half mile radius of Sharon South and it was on the news in the Quail Hollow neighborhood. I'm pretty convinced it was the same guy and his friend. If there's any cmpd law enforcement reading this, I just saw these two going from car to car looking in each for stuff to come back and steal tonight no doubt. The ran off when they knew they were being observed. Better step up patrols around Sharon South/Qual Hollow area. "

Via class pass ($90/month), I've tried Cycle South (awesome place, but basically $200/month), Flywheel (similar, and a pain to get to) and a couple others.

"When we engage in blatant power grabs, there are consequences beyond merely writing bad laws and disrespecting the voters.

This is on a throwaway for obvs reasons. I would like a job in the Charlotte area but I can't drive.

"Here's what's happening:This week we were called into a special, emergency session to address the needs of those suffering in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.  We passed a disaster relief bill and were adjourned.Then - unexpectedly - we were immediately called into a second special session with no clear agenda. I can assure you that no one in my party saw it coming. It was a complete surprise.They said all bills for this new session - which had no parameters - had to be filed by 7pm.  By 6pm there was still nothing.  In the next hour they filed over two dozen bills affecting all types of issues.  Lots of these bills are over 40 pages long and have clearly been in the works for weeks if not months.One of them strips power from incoming Governor-elect Roy Cooper in a number of ways: makes his cabinet appointments subject to General Assembly approval, dramatically reduces the number of employees that report to him (they now report to the General Assembly), and more.  They basically stripped as much power as they felt they constitutionally could.Nothing is law yet - we're still in session and will start voting this afternoon.  The bill about limiting Roy Cooper's powers is likely to pass, but it's unclear how many of the other bills have support from leadership.We have no filibuster and they have the votes to pass any of them.  And Gov. McCrory almost certainly won't veto anything.  So what can you do?  One big answer: Get ready for 2017.  A federal court has ordered that we redraw our districts because they were racially gerrymandered.  That means that all of your 17 legislators in Meck will have to stand for re-election, and that they'll all be in new districts.  Some of those districts will be newly competitive.  A pick-up of a handful of seats in the state House or Senate would allow us to sustain Gov. Cooper's veto, and that changes the entire political landscape.Until then, feel free to be in touch with me anytime at Jacksonforncsenate@gmail.com.Regardless of your political party, you deserve leadership that respects you enough not to govern by ambush and circumvent the outcomes of elections. Right now, you don't have that.As I type, I can hear protesters inside the building chanting.  I hope we can channel this into a real get-out-the-vote effort in 2017, or I have to keep giving you depressing updates like this, instead of reporting on action that would actually make you proud of your state government. I think we can get there."

"Hello great people of Charlotte! Below is a true story. It's christmas time and I started to wonder what ever happened to this guy. I want to know if he ever made it home and reunited with his father. Sadly, I can't remember his name, I just know he's from Charlotte, NC. I'm from Europe and English is not my first language so bare with me. November 11th, 2015. 3AM at Miami airport/Greyhound bus station. I didn't have a credit card to buy the tickets online, so I had to buy them from the station. I arrived 9 hours early. Spent my last 120 bucks on New Orleans bus tickets. Had about 70 cents to buy food for the next 30 hours. I'm already hungry as hell. I see a bag of chips on the bench outside. They're not mine, but I'm going to eat them. I sit down and see another figure sitting in the dark on the other side of the bench. Something tells me they're his. I sit down and wait, just in case. I notice he's keeping an eye on them too. Half a hour passes in silence. Finally I stand up. ""These yours?"" I point at the chips. ""Nah, thought they were yours."" Well what the fuck, let's split it then. I victoriously open the bag and we feast on the bench. He says he's from Charlotte, North Carolina. Great guy, really humble. He had a big argument with his father, hopped on the bus in the heat of the moment and ended up in Miami 30 hours later. Now he regrets it and wants to go back home. I tell him I'm sure his father really loves him, no matter what. Kinda like me, he has an empty stomach and no money left. We spend the next couple of hours talking about life, wandering around the airport and transit center. Finally, early in the morning it's time for me to get on the bus. First stop, Orlando, 5 hours away, happens to be on the route to North Carolina also. I know I can't leave him here, so I'm trying to figure out a way to get him on the bus. But he doesn't have a ticket and we don't have single dollar.We get in the line to board the bus. There's a super strict conductor outside, checking every ticket closely before letting a person enter. She acts like she has the most important job ever. I tell him to go behind the bus and wait for my mark. Finally, it's my turn. I walk up to the lady with my duffle and pretend to be looking for my ticket. I make a scene like a girl on puberty. I empty out the bag, throwing my shorts and shirts in the air. ""I can't find my ticket, I know I put it in the bag!"" In the middle of my tantrum I see him run behind the conductor into the bus. Mission accomplished. I smile, I put my stuff back in the duffle and take my ticket out of my back pocket. I'll never forget the conductors face when I gave her the ticket. She checks it and I get on the bus.I sit in the back of the bus. A fist appears from behind me. ""Thanks."" No problem haha. I dap him and we both fall asleep. I see him one last time in Orlando when we exit the bus. I just have this one selfie of us lol. I hadn't slept for like 35 hours. He's the guy on the right.:http://imgur.com/a/bLdapI know this is kind of random, but I thought it's worth a try! Happy holidays everybody!"

"Hey Everyone, So basically I dropped the ball when submitting my notice to vacate to my apartment complex. They require 60 days notice but I only gave them 30, meaning that I'll be financially responsible for the additional 30 days unless a new tenant is found by my move-out date of January 11th. The apartment just went on the market but since it's in my best interest to find someone asap I thought I'd post here to see if there were any interest. My lease terms would transfer to the new person - it would be a 13 month lease with a base rent of $784. If you'd rather rent month-to-month instead of the full 13, the rent would be $1,014.

"Hey everyone!  I'm 24/M and live in Belmont (just outside Charlotte off I85, 15 minutes from the airport, 20 from downtown) and I am looking for a male roommate.  I have a 2BR/1 1/2 BA townhome I'm currently renting by myself and I have an open bedroom.  The neighbors here are really quiet.  One of the reasons I need a roommate is because I travel somewhat frequently for work (twice a month or so) and I have a Morkie (dog), which is a challenge to plan out and deal with while I'm gone.  If you're willing to simply watch him and take him out a few times a day while I'm gone I am open to taking some $ off your portion of the rent.Ideally, you're not crazy loud (parties are fun but not every day!) and reliable.  The last thing I need is someone who doesn't pay their bills on time.  If you're interested please shoot me a message.  I'd love to talk!EDIT: I realized I should probably list the rent price here.  The whole townhouse is $900 a month, which would be split 50/50 (minus a few $ for you if you would be willing to help with my dog while I'm gone)."

Tryon to the East, and Billy Graham Parkway (plus a lil extra) to the North. It includes Renaissance Park & Golf Course. **This neighborhood doesn't show up in the wiki, nor is available for flair!**I stumbled across this because I'm identifying a place to move. I narrowed it down to Hideaway Lake and Courtney Oaks. When I looked at their locations, I realized that Eagle Lake pushes down from Shopton Road just to capture the land that Courtney Oaks occupies while Hideaway Lake wasn't included. Would this provide any benefits for Courtney Oaks residents for being part of the Eagle Lake neighborhood? I'm really torn between these two apartments. Thanks, y'a!l! "

Hey there everyone! I wanted to start this off with thanking everyone who made the first of what I hope to be many Saturday meetups a definite success. As for this week, we will be heading out to a new tap room and wine bar in Matthews, [Seaboard Tap Room](http://carolinabeertemple.net/1017). Opening just this August, Seaboard is currently only a tap room featuring 24 taps of some great craft beers as well as some excellent foreign beers that we don't often get on our rotation. Seaboard has their own brewery behind them slated to open in the summer of next year to add to their offerings. As a new tap house their kitchen is not open yet, though they do serve cheese boards, dips, sandwiches, your typical bar fare. To go with this, Seaboard is situated in the historic downtown district of Matthews so outside food is welcome and there is plenty to choose from in walking distance. I hope to see everyone out there for what I can attest to as an excellent new tap room!

SURPRISE! This has been a long time in the thought process, though I have to give /u/CasualAffair a large portion of the credit for the idea, we will be having a SATURDAY (yes, you read that right) meetup this week in addition to our Tuesday meetup. We'll be hitting up [Blue Blaze Brewing](http://www.blueblazebrewing.com/?overTwentyOne=yes) since they are closed on Tuesdays. Blue Blaze is brand new, opening only in June of this year! This will be my first time at Blue Blaze so I can't give my impressions as usual, but I have yet to hear a bad word about their beers or their atmosphere and that has me very excited! As for the future we are absolutely continuing our regular Tuesday meetup, but if the interest is there, these Saturday meetups may become more common! So come on down to Blue Blaze and hang out with some awesome people!
"Anyone know why there is a large helicopter circling above the derita area right now near Graham and sugar creek? I don't think it's a news chopper, since it's a big dual-rotor helicopter.I was taking out the trash and noticed it overhead and it keeps circling around the area"

"I've been staying in Charlotte for a while now for work that just finished up today, and my flight out isn't until Monday morning.So what should I do until then besides hang out at my hotel by the airport and watch Netflix?

Looking for a way to play squash in Charlotte, ideally with some sort of league/group.

Any other options by chance?

Due to various reasons, we are moving into a house without a garage. At the previous place I had been in the process of setting up a pretty decent workshop and launching my business, Charlotte Woodworks.

Would any of you be able to point me I'm the right direction?

"So this is a long shot probably and a bit of a weird request but posting for my man companion / husband, to see what happens.Said husband is a Navy combat veteran with PTSD (not violent or a harm to others) but is currently unable to work while dealing with the VA, processing his disability claim,  getting his head straight and other associated things.

"Hi Charlotte,Currently living/working for a Fortune 500 working from home in FL, but have been dancing with a company here in Charlotte.

Went to Concord, Concord Mills, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Uptown, near CLT, Carowinds, Fort Mill, SC, eta. I will be heading out tomorrow but do have a few hours to spare in the AM to tour other interesting locations.I've never been to Charlotte, let alone NC. I do have to say during my time here thus far has been great and the winter weather is a nice reprieve from FL weather.I have a few questions for the locals:1. How do you like it here?2. What makes Charlotte home?3. Best places to live (< 250k) ?4. Best schools?5. Traffic always this bad? Alternative transportation?6. State Income tax % (none in FL)?7. How often does it snow?8.

Hey there guys! Thanks to everyone for a great meetup this past Saturday! This week we'll be heading over to [Legion Brewing](http://legionbrewing.com/) over in Plaza. One of Charlotte's best newer offerings, Legion has quickly built up a devoted following among beer lovers in the area thanks to its knowledgeable staff and passionate brewers. They make sure to keep a [diverse beer list](http://legionbrewing.com/beer/) with Juicy Jay being one of the perennial favorites (though I'm particularly looking forward to trying the First-52 Imperial Stout). Legion has a small appetizers style menu but for anyone craving a more full meal, [Pizza Peel](http://tapandpeel.com/central/food-menu/) delivers to the brewery and has excellent pizza. Don't forget Tuesdays at Legion are trivia night! So come join us and let's try to make it 3 consecutive visits with a trivia victory! Hope to see you all there!

"Hiya r/charlotte!Hoping one of you might be able to help me ( or you know someone who can help me).  I'll try to keep this brief.I have a very dear friend who has a debilitating disease.  I don't want to share her private information publicly, but she is in her early 30's and has declined so rapidly that she has been forced to pick between a lifetime of being cared for by others or a drug that could give her more time being mostly upwardly mobile, but also could kill her at pretty much any moment.  She has decided on the latter, and wants to make sure that she really LIVES.So, I want to help my friend really live, and we are working on planning an epic roadtrip.  She wants to see things she's never seen and go places she's always wanted to go, and I want to help her do that.  Because her income is limited ( she's currently on disability), I am happily footing the bill.  So that she can experience as much as possible, I'm trying to keep certain costs low so we can spend money in other areas.  We are going to camp our way through the roadtrip, but she really cannot tent camp due to her physical restrictions.This is where I am looking for help.  Pop-up and pull behind campers are available for rent, but are pretty costly and cut into our ability to pay for other parts of the trip pretty significantly.  I have a vehicle that can tow, and so I'm wondering if anyone here might have a camper that I could privately rent for 1-2 weeks this summer.  I don't want something for nothing- I can pay what you think it would be worth... I just can't afford the $100 a day that rental agencies charge.  I would also be happy to purchase supplemental insurance, provide a driving record, criminal background check or anything else that would help someone feel comfortable with renting us their camper.  We are flexible with the timing, but sometime between Memorial Day and Labor Day is our target.I'm happy to give more information privately, but if it helps any, I'm a 39 year old mom, a homeowner, a girl scout troop leader.  I'm really just looking for a bit of help in making this happen for my very dear and very deserving friend, and I am hoping one of you might be able to help us out.Thanks so much for your time."

"Hey all. Considering taking a job in Charlotte, currently living in the PacNW. I've spent some time visiting / traveling through the South, but I've never seriously considered living there. GF and I are youngish (mid20s) and we'd be making about 90k/year. My job would be in Ayrsley, she'd be in medical. I did a bunch of reading on here for actual amenities / neighborhoods / etc, but I mostly wanted to see if there are any PacNWers here, and just get a sense of the attitude of the city, etc. I'm pretty used to Seattle, which is a very modern, fresh, energetic, fairly liberal city; I've never been to Charlotte, or NC. I have a friend who lives there, and she said it's a surprisingly young city with the banks and medical communities. Thoughts? Also, general thoughts on whether you'd move into Charlotte from out of the area if you had a choice? We're both pretty open to where we end up, just want to work in a job that we both enjoy. For me, this is a good opportunity, and she'd do well as well. We're not actively seeking or not seeking the South. Feel free to be honest, I'd rather know now. :) We're both very outdoorsy, I do triathlon / biking / hiking / running, etc. Thanks all. :) "
"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.  The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"
"We're the couple from The REDdit Wedding who successfully got local redditors to take part in our courthouse nuptials in July.

It's been awhile since I went to a jersey mikes and holy shit. I was astounded when the card reader prompted me if I wanted to tip.

Hey there everyone! I'm so sorry for the late post, sick days make for busy weeks! Time for another Saturday meetup to give the local breweries closed on Tuesdays a chance to strut their stuff. This week we're heading to [Three Spirits Brewery](http://www.threespiritsbrewery.com/)! Probably my favorite brewery in all of Charlotte, Three Spirits offers a selection of [delicious beers](http://www.threespiritsbrewery.com/index.php/our-beers-2/) with Sweet Memories being one of my favorite beers period. Their beers exhibit a remarkable flavor and body while typically staying below the 7% mark for ABV giving beers that are enjoyable and easy to drink. For food the brewery is partnered with [Olde Pineville Premium Pub](http://oldpinevillepremiumpub.com/menu/) located about a block away whom deliver to the brewery. I've been looking forward to having a meetup here so I can't wait to see you all there and share this lesser known gem with you all!

Just seeing if there are any leads available! Thank you!

"Good morning Charlotte.  I might be moving to the Charlotte area in the future and it occurred to me that I am not familiar with any big electronic music shows/festivals/concerts ever happening in Charlotte or in North Carolina in general so I looked it up and it turns out you guys have a ton of EDM acts that play down there!  Here are just a few up coming shows:LotusMarkus SchulzBlack Tiger Sex MachineExcision**TCHAMI!!**Big GiganticCosmic GateLouis the ChildThe FlooziesMinnisotaSpace JesusIll.Gates.I've been in the rave scene in NYC for over a decade and it's a passion I hold near and dear to my heart.  To put it quite bluntly, if I do move down there, I would be in need of a new rave crew!  If you're a raver and your rave crew would like 1 more, or you're not a raver but are curious about the scene, hit me up and lets talk EDM!  Thank you for your time and have a lovely day ;]"

"Over the past two months my gas bill has nearly tripled, and then doubled on top of that. Since I moved into my place in May 2016 my bill was somewhere between $13 and $15 a month. My last bill was $37 and change, and this new bill was $70 and change. The gas is connected to the range and the hot water heater. Both my electric bill and water bill were the same as usual, if not lower than normal. I wasn't even home for three weeks during the stretch of both bills. I called the company and they ran the numbers for the property and it showed a spike in cost during this time of the year for the previous residents as well. They are sending someone out to check the line and meter, but I'm guessing they won't find anything. Has this happened to anyone else? It just doesn't seem to make much sense since all living habits are the same. EDIT: Solved: Gas line is connected to the hot water heater. Hot water heater is connected to the heat pump. Heat pump has a coil that fills with hot water and a fan blows through creating heat. "
"Uhm... so, I took my trash out this morning and when I arrived home my trash can was missing.

There was nothing of value in it and if someone happened to think my food scraps and random junk were of any use, still no need to take the entire can.I guess I'll call up 311 in the morning and ask for a new one. Looking at their website it sounds like I'll have to cough up $40 for a new one which sucks... but the question of WTF happened to my trash can is still bugging me. Has anyone had similar experiences?

Hey there everyone! As another week starts, we have another meetup to look forward to, this week at [NoDa Brewing](http://nodabrewing.com/home/)! One of Charlotte's old dogs in the brewing game, NoDa offers a [great selection](http://nodabrewing.com/the-beer/) of beers. Probably best known for their pale ales (specifically Jam Session and Hop, Drop, and Roll), NoDa has a selection of dark beers and red ales that surprises many. The brewery also offers a weekly rotating tap for some of their more adventurous brews. For food, NoDa plays host to [The Tin Kitchen Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/TheTINKitchen/), whom some of you will recognize from Sugar Creek as an excellent take on Mexican street food with a twist. Everyone should be able to find something they love about NoDa brewing and it is a perfect place for someone looking to start their journey into the world of craft beer that so many have fallen in love with! Hope to see you all there!

"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.  The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

"Sign-ups went live: October 4, 2016  Box mounted to my house: January 19, 2017 One of the neatest parts of the Google rollout was learning that my ""fiberhood"" has a name. I've lived here nearly a decade and have never heard this area called ""Prosperity Village"" prior to Google's labeling. Highland Creek's rollout happened first and was to the north/northeast of this area. I'm fairly sure the Google installers have been working east-to-west as they ran cable, and by that measure suspect I'm at the furthest terminal ass-end of the Prosperity Village range. (If I'm not, then I can see the end from here.)Yesterday a nice contractor came out to wonder about the feasibility of digging around numerous exposed tree roots while avoiding existing buried cables and such. Today a fellow with a Ditch Witch laid the cable through my yard and affixed the box to the side of my house. Next up should be a contact from the inside installer, and hopefully not long after that I'll be able to visit Speedtest for a lovely four-figure result. Of course, that assumes that ""guy running cable to my house"" is one of the last steps to occur; I don't know that the conduit has made it all the way through our neighborhood yet. I've seen S&N trucks out there for what feels like years and there's still a big ol' conduit loop being installed within half a mile of me. Maybe Google's just trying to get their contractors to move ahead of AT&T?

Can someone please let me know if this is one of the topics for this rally?  I am hoping not, because I feel this lie takes away so much from what could otherwise be a great movement.Sorry to bring this up, I just can't stand liars and dishonesty and can't show up to a rally pushing this lie.  Anyways, thanks for any information."
"The company I work for is relocating their current warehouse from East Westinghouse Blvd to a location near Graham St & Atando, about halfway between Derita and NoDa.  The place we are at now on Westinghouse I feel is a safe area.  When I look at spotcrime and crimeincharlotte.com, it appears the location we are moving to has a much higher crime rate as compared to where we are now.  20 years ago, I lived near Derita, so my only experiences with that area are, well, from 20 years ago.  So I don't know what that area is like now in 2017. How much higher is the crime rate?  When I look through there within 5 blocks of the building, I notice there are absolutely zero big name businesses, not even a BP or exxon, so that worries me that not one big company feels like it's safe enough to have a business there.  Not even a McDonalds!  Am I over-reacting in thinking it's still an unsafe area like it was 20 years ago?  Or are there no restaurants or gas stations because it's just heavy-industrial? A few of my co-workers (most are not Charlotte locals, they commute during the week from out of state) think I am nuts for being mildly fearful, and have (jokingly?) offered to give me gun training. tl;dr:  Should I be looking for a different job because it's not a safe area?  Or do I just need to put my big-girl panties on and deal with it?"
"Hey everyone, I've recently started up a new band with some musicians in Charlotte.

I just came from a open mic as a fan and came to the conclusion id really like to perform again and it would be cool if i had friends lol.

I'm still trying get my "mojo" back musically but in the meantime where are the indie artists, musicians, filmmakers, writers etc and where are your scenes. Sorry if this is a ramble.

Noise pollution is just at an all time high, and people actually think interruptions and being loud is ""collaborative"" and a good thing. Anyways, I already know about the usual suspects like 7th street market, Sunflower baking, Earls grocery.

Hey there everyone! I hope everyone had an excellent weekend and has an easy Monday. It's time for another meetup, this week we're heading over to [Sycamore Brewing](http://sycamorebrew.com/), everyone's favorite rapidly rotating tap brewery. Due to the aforementioned rotation schedule, Sycamore has given up trying to maintain an online taplist, but I will suffice to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed every beer I've had there. From deep, rich stouts and porters to fresh, crisp ales and wits, Sycamore's brewers manage to run the full gambit of styles and flavors, so there should be something for everyone! On Tuesdays Sycamore breaks out its in house kitchen of paninis, though if that doesn't fit your fancy I'll probably be walking down the street to Blaze Pizza before heading home and would be more than happy to continue hanging out with everyone there! Hope to see you all there!

Avid reader, library enthusiast looking for a great place to pick up some used books. I make the occasional goodwill stop to find a few good books here and there, and my fiancÃ© and I currently frequent The Last Word on Tryon as well as 2nd & Charles. Any good used book stores in Charlotte that you would suggest?? We have only been here a year and those are the only two ones we have found that sell a good sized selection of used books at reasonable prices. We have been to park road books as well but it's not used books, as well as book buyers which we weren't terribly impressed with as far as selection goes. Might have to give that one another chance. Haven't been to book rack but I think we may go there today! So other than those four, any good/other suggestions?? All thoughts appreciated!!

This might be a bit of a long shot, but figured it was worth a try.  I've got illegal tint on my white MK7 GTI (20% all around minus the windshield, 35% is legal).

This is my first real business, and would love some tips to start off well. Thanks for any input!Links if interested: https://www.theboxescaperoom.com https://www.facebook.com/theboxclt/"




"I lost my SD Memory around Amelie's off of Pineville-Matthew. I have been really busy with graduating and interviewing for full time positions (got a job hurray) but lost track of my SD memory card. I remember last having it at Amelie's around three weeks ago. It has pictures of me abroad in Vienna, Athens, Munich, Santorini, Prague, Budapest, etc. I am an Asian male on exchange at the time. If you're able to find said SD card, I am offering a 50 dollar, no questions asked reward.I know it's a stretch finding a lost item but I am hoping for some luck and miracle."
"Hello all, Since there is no Checkers subforum, I decided to post this here. The girlfriend and I are going to be going to our first charlotte checkers game and I have a few questions. 1. What is parking like at the old coliseum? I've never actually been to anything there ever. 2. Is the Red Line Club any good? I saw it on the checkers website and thought about reservations but I figured I'd poll people before reserving any space. thanks! "
"As the title says... I need my license renewed and I want to figure out the best day, time, and place to go to get in and out of the DMV. I don't want to be sitting in a long ass line just to do something that I imagine takes about 5 minutes. Before anyone asks or responds... I can't do it online because my license isn't the correct type of license eligible for online renewal. :(Thanks!"
I hopped on the Pokemon Go bandwagon and am still enjoying it.  It's got me wondering about Ingress which I know came first.  I looked and what I'd heard is true, that Niantic re-used a lot of Ingress portals for pokestops and gyms so I thought I'd give it a try, since I'm always visiting pokestops in and around Mint Hill where I live.  I was just curious if there are many other players in and around Charlotte?

"Hi all, I'm about to get a couple cheaper suits, and I'm looking for a reasonably priced place that will do some alterations and get me some accurate measurements. I'm really stressing the reasonable, as I'm halfway through losing about 100 pounds so alterations are gonna be every couple months most likely, and I'm buying cheap suits anyway so minimal money spent is key. Anybody know a place?"

"Hey yall. I'm newish to Charlotte and trying to make new friends that don't revolve around microbreweries or football. I've always loved watching Comedy and I see Charlotte had some venues, any of yall recommend any in particular? I see the Comedy Zone has some sort of Comedy Battle on Tuesdays that seem cool. Don't know the atmosphere of the place though.I've also always been into comics and the like and while I don't have much experience with tabletop games, it's always seemed interesting to me. I looked up local comic book shops but don't see much in the way events and stuff. So any suggestions in this regard would also be appreciated!And in a past life I used to love clubbing and stuff but that seems like an effort, hah. But if people can comd alone to someplace and do that sort of thing, I'm open to that to.Thanks yall!"
"I'm trying to get a quick understanding about what it's like to live in Charlotte, NC. I've researched a little, but there isn't too much I can find online. I'm an upperclassmen in college at an internship in Boston. I thought living in a big city would be fun, but I have quickly realized it's not really my style. I was just wondering what Charlotte felt like for y'all. Can you own a house outside of the city and commute downtown with ease? Are the surrounding areas full of nice suburbs? Is owning a car easy? What is the housing situation like? How is it for young professionals? If you could maybe answer those questions and maybe add what you like or dislike, that'd be amazing! Thanks!"

"Does anyone know if there's cheap chinese food massages here like in Texas and California? (These areas have large numbers of Asian people.)

"Hey there everybody! It seems like these meetups are really picking up some steam with another great Saturday. This week we're heading over to [Flight Beer Hall](http://flightclt.com/). One of the favorites on the rotation, Flight offers a unique experience for local beers, allowing you to try [craft beers](http://flightclt.com/beers-on-tap/) from all across North Carolina with 91 beers on tap. With Tuesday being their 22oz night, all 22oz pours are the same cost as their 16oz pours giving you more bang for your buck. Flight also offers a [great menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) of bar fare, my favorite being their mac n' cheese.On a side note, this week marks my one year anniversary of hosting these meetups and I want to take a second to thank everyone here on /r/Charlotte for coming out and enjoying these with me. Whether you only came once or you're a regular, having everyone out there each week, enjoying these breweries alongside me has meant a lot. So here's to all you guys for playing a big part in making these meetups happen and let's hope for another year!"
"Hi folks!As some of you may know, North Carolina used to allow cities/counties to use Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) (also called Ranked Choice Voting) for their local elections. But this law expired back in 2011.We are a group of like-minded individuals across NC who are organizing a 2017 legislative push to re-allow cities and counties in NC to use IRV in their local elections (if they so desire).**Charlotte Help:** We need help from anybody in the Charlotte area who would be willing to reach out to your various NC Senators & NC House Representatives in Mecklenburg County and get their sign-on to support this.Let me know if you're interested, and I can give you more details!btw, here is wiki link for anyone who simply wants to learn more about IRV: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#United_StatesThank you for your time!!"

"Due to the severe weather, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will be closed for students on Tuesday, Jan. 10. Students will not report to school. All CMS staff will report to work at 11 a.m.    For schools on the traditional calendar, the make-up day for students will be Friday, Feb. 20. The student make-up day for Project L.I.F.T. Continuous Learning Schools Walter G. Byers and Bruns Academy will be Friday, March 17. Druid Hills and Thomasboro academies will not make up the student day because they already have 19 additional days built into their calendar.    While many roadways and CMS campuses are clear, weather reports indicate there may be black ice and refreezing, which could cause roads to be unsafe during the early morning. Despite day-long efforts to remove ice from parking lots and walkways at school campuses in all nine learning communities, there is still significant amounts of dangerous ice in many areas. Five tons of ice melt have been used thus far and 750 pounds will be spread tonight and tomorrow. Approximately, 50 school campuses continue to have limited access due to the ice. The goal is to provide safe access for staff by 11 a.m. Tuesday.    Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions."
"I may be out of line for not waiting to post this tomorrow in the tirade thread, but I feel like it needs to be said because I noticed a LOT of cars on 85 between China Grove and Belmont with this problem... Residual ice flying off the hoods and roofs.PLEASE, don't just scrape enough ice off your windshield that you can see through it good enough to drive . What you THINK is snow sitting on top of your car has turned into a pretty solid sheet of ice, and as soon as the air catches it while your running 55+ it becomes a pretty serious risk to other drivers as it goes flying through the air. The larger pieces that don't break apart in the air can do some damage. Not to mention the drivers who freak out and start swerving like crazy trying to avoid it, and risk causing even more problems or accidents. Or striking pedestrians for Christ's sake... I spent 10 minutes cleaning off my car yesterday, after letting it sit throughout the snow, and entire next day. Where I park is pretty shady, so there was no real chance of anything melting in the sun. But, 10 minutes.... that's all it took. 10 minutes is very much worth avoiding the risk of causing a melee on 85. Scrape the glass entirely. On the hood and trunk if you lightly tap your fist, it will break up the ice into smaller little chunks that will slide off easily with a little help. Same goes for the roof. It's not going to dent you car unless your trying to full on punch it like you're training for the next UFC event.Also, do NOT use hot water. You'll crack the fuck out of your glass. Hell, don't use water at all. And make sure your wipers aren't frozen into an ice block on the cowl of your car. If they are, DIG THEM OUT. You will NEED wipers. And lastly, for future reference... Cardboard or towels are great for covering your windshield and preventing the ice scrape headache. So, think about that next time we have snow in the forecast, or a freeze warning with any precipitation expected. When you park your car at home after grabbing your bread and milk, just cover up the front and rear windshield if its gonna be exposed to the elements.I'm really not trying to be an ass. I just don't want to hear a news report about a family in a minivan being killed on their way to Disney World because some person's car let go of a huge chunk of ice. "

I'm sure this post will sound petty, but looking for advice nonetheless. I have had acrylic nails for a few months now, but am ready to take them off now that I am starting my nursing job. I read recently that they shouldn't be popped/pried off, which is what the nail salon I had been going to does, as it rips off several layers of the nail--not to mention it hurts. Does anyone know of a place in Charlotte that files/soaks them off correctly? I'm worried about screwing up my nail beds more than they already are. Thanks in advance!

"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.

Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

"I've mentioned this before, but I'd like to add to my angst with the roads around Charlotte. I can think of 3 issues with the roads currently:- Yellow and white lines have faded over time and are thus hard to see. - The road reflects everything, especially after a rain, making it difficult to tell what lane you're in. I can see the reflection of every street light well before I end up crossing it.- I have not seen one reflector anywhere in Charlotte. Maybe I'm spoiled coming from Florida, where I never had any visibility issues, rain or shine. The lack of reflectors is the biggest surprise to me. It's not just me, either. Almost every meetup I've been to where rain has been a factor in getting there, at least one person complains it was scary driving due to the rain and bad visibility.Maybe time to invest in roads?

We're trying to purchase an older home in the area and we're running in to some problems with it. One of the problems is that the cellar was flooded (puddles, not ponds) when we visited last Monday and Wednesday and we pumped it out manually both days. It was dry today as well as the first time we visited. We had an inspector and a plumber come out and they only had guesses as to what was going on. Plumber said his basement in Concord had flooded as well though, but said since we're on higher ground that it was strange. They had both guessed that it could be the water heater and to check back today, but since it was dry that's not the case. Wondered if this happened to anyone else, or if we have to worry about a structural problem?

Hopefully the weather permits and we can have a great Saturday to start off this new year!

I get the impression a lot of people from outside North Carolina end up in Charlotte, so I imagine that has to help. Also, how is the dating scene for single 30 year old guy?"


"I am in need of getting my straight razors honed and have not bought the stones to do it myself. Does anybody near Charlotte do this that would be willing to do it for me and allow me to come and learn how to do it?If not, what are some suggestions for honing? I am thinking of sending it off to SRD."
Happy New Year everyone! I hope everyone had a great weekend and isn't too hungover as we start the week. It's time for the first meetup of 2017, and to start off the year we're heading to [Legal Remedy Brewing](http://legalremedybrewing.com/). Just across the border in Rock Hill, Legal Remedy offers one of the more [eclectic beer selections](http://legalremedybrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/beer-list.pdf) of any individual brewery that we visit, particularly their rotating seasonal taps. For those of you who have been with us to Flight, you know my love of their White Chocolate Mocha Blonde Stout. Pairing with their excellent brews perhaps the best [food selection](http://legalremedybrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/food-menu.pdf) on the rotation so far, Legal Remedy has a bit of something for everyone. Well worth the slightly longer drive than usual, Legal Remedy has become a favorite among the regulars and I hope we can add you all to their fans. I hope to see you all there!

"I'm toying with the idea of cutting all my hair off and doing an undercut or long pixie kind of thing. I haven't had good luck with any hair stylists in Charlotte yet, I always walk away somewhat disappointed, do my hair has just been growing and growing. Very tired of long hair at the moment. I'm hoping someone on here knows a place to go that's good with non traditional hairstyles on women. Edit to add: I did search the subreddit back a year or so but didn't see recommendations for the type of stylist I'm looking for.

Thank you! Links to our social media accounts:[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1777284549190556/)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/@CLTSciMarch)[Instagram](https://instagram.com/charlottesciencemarch)[Website](http://charlottemarchforscience.com/) And a little about our mission:The March for Science is a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted."
"Hey there Charlottons (or whatever you call yourselves), I'm just here asking about the town and local job market. I'll be moving to the South Park area within a few weeks, I have been told it's plesant to live there so I am happy (hopefully), is there anything to do besides buy stuff at the mall?

"Hey everyone,Just recently moved to Charlotte about 3 months ago after I accepting a job with a big company. My wife and son had to stay behind in VA while I save up money and get acquainted with the area, but they will be coming down shortly. In the interim while I wait for my family, I'm wondering if anyone would have some advice on how to get my wife's photography business started. Before we came down to the VA/NC area, we were living in Chicago for about 5 years when she started her business. Using Craigslist as her primary source of advertisements, she was able to maintain a fairly consistent volume of business, especially during the spring/summer. By the end of our stay in Chicago, she was doing so much business that she had to turn people down. She worked primarily as a professional wedding photographer.Fast-forward to today, her business has basically died and we can't seem to find a way to resurrect it. Her charges have been affordable and she has fluctuated her prices to try to see if it makes a difference. We've been posting on Craigslist in the Charlotte area with minimal responses. I'm wondering if anyone has some advice or information about the market, even from a consumer perspective (what websites to search for photographers, what are the best venues, etc.). My wife is talented and enjoys her work. Here is a link to some of her work : https://www.facebook.com/StylersStudioAny help or advice is appreciated. Thank you."
I plan on getting the interior of my house painted later this year (walls, trim, ceiling, doors - the whole shabang). I plan on getting a few estimates this summer but I am curious what I'll be looking at in terms of cost. My house is 1100 sq ft, 8 ft ceilings. I probably won't be including the kitchen or bathroom in the job, just living area, hallway & 2 of the bedrooms. I was thinking it'd be in the $2000-$2500 range but I don't want to be in shock if the estimates come back a lot higher than that. Has anyone had this done recently and willing to disclose the cost? Thanks in advance :)
I am looking for cherry trees in bloom in the Charlotte area to use for a family photo shoot this Sunday. This is a special shoot to us because it commemorates the anniversary of my son's death. The cherry trees were in bloom when he died and it is a little way we can include him in our family pictures by using the trees as a backdrop. Unfortunately, the early bloom this season means I can not find a location that still has cherry trees in bloom. I called UNCC Botanical Gardens today and they said their cherry trees are done, the office park near us has already finished blooming, etc. I didn't call Daniel Stowe due to the cost prohibitive $250 location fee on top of our photographer's sitting fee. So, I am turning to Reddit to see if anyone knows of any cherry trees in bloom this Sunday anywhere in the CLT region. Thank you so much for any help. 
So the new Nintendo switch comes out on Friday, but certain places are having a midnight launch for it Thursday night. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a preorder but really want to get my hands on one since it might be weeks or even longer to get one after launch. The only place so far that I saw having a midnight release is the best buy up in the Northlake mall. Has anyone heard of any other places that will be having one? Also, would getting to the store by 9-10 pm be a waste of time? I've never really waited in line for a console, so I have no idea if it will be crowded and just a waste of my time. Thanks

"I took over the subreddit from an inactive mod a year or two ago and added some custom CSS to it, as well as filling it myself with content and cross-promoting it in other subreddits.

For food this week, Birdsong has [A Worth Dogg Food Truck](https://www.foodtrucksin.com/worthy-dog) listed as coming, but if they aren't there they have free peanuts, some delivery menus, and a few places down the road in NoDa that we go to afterwards from time to time.

I knew of the Independence, but don't care for soccer much, and I admittedly know nothing about lacross save for the fact that it looks like a sort of grass hockey. Despite my ignorance of the sport, I'm hoping to catch a game sometime during their regular season and learn more... According to what I've read, Memorial Stadium is their current home, and given the recent MLS debate, and possible demise of that facility for the Smith family to build a soccer-tropolis, I wonder where they would play home games unless they were to stay at the new location as well.**Bonus Prize** - I went to the Hounds website and they are having a stupid awesome sale on apparel if anyone is interested in sporting some local colors. I was thinking of getting a jersey just for the fact that they look prety damn cool."
"I recently moved to Concord and need a vet for my dog. I searched this subreddit and Animal Medical on Monroe rd has a lot of recommendations but it's about 20 miles from my place. I'd prefer someone closer if you guys have any good recommendations other than Animal Medical."


Had lunch here today.  Besides being a bit pricey it was one of the better lunches that I've had in a long time.  Great flavors and interesting choices. I recommend a visit if you have the money and time.  They also have cool wall art.
Is anyone selling two tickets to the AJR concert this Friday at the Evening Muse? There are apparently two separate concerts that night at the same venue and I bought tickets for the wrong one. Now AJR is sold out. This is a stretch but figured I'd give it a shot. Thanks all.

My company gives me an extra day off so that I can choose to volunteer for any 501(c)(3) non-profit organization throughout the year. I was interested in doing this for an organization that supports women's reproductive rights or women's rights in general. I am also open to other non-profits, I have done Habitat before (last year) and build storage sheds. What Charlotte groups are there that will take a volunteer for one day?
Hey there everyone! It's time for another meetup, this week at one of the favorites, if not the favorite, on the Tuesday rotation, we're at [Wooden Robot Brewing](https://woodenrobotbrewery.com/). Home to an [excellent tap list](https://woodenrobotbrewery.com/taproom/), many people will recognize them for their pale ales, like their Overachiever, and their blonde ales, like the Good Morning Vietnam. However, with styles ranging from stouts to sours there is something for everyone on the list at Wooden Robot. Alongside their brewery, Wooden Robot has paired up with [Twisted Eats Food Truck](http://www.kre8events.com/twisted-eats-menu) to create a food menu where each item incorporates a beer from the brewery. I hope you can all make it out with us!
"Hi there!I am currently living in China, but am moving back to the U.S. with my wife (Chinese) in a few months. I am considering Charlotte as a place to move to and would like to ask a few questions about Charlotte's Chinese community. I know places like San Francisco, LA, Chicago, New York, and Houston have large Chinese populations with well established Chinatowns, but I have already lived in several of those places and I am looking for a slightly smaller sized city (in comparison to those places). My questions are as follows:* Is there a Chinese-centric area anywhere? What is it like?* Any bilingual Mandarin programs in the schools?* How are the Chinese restaurants? Any dim-sum places on the weekends?* What is the employment demand like for Mandarin speakers? Also, if anyone in this sub has lived in China before/is from China, here are some questions for you guys: * Are there any authentic/non-americanized Chinese food?* Any hot-pot places?I appreciate any information you guys have. Thanks!"

"Hi all,My husband has decided to start biking to work on occasion. He works uptown and takes the light rail from Arrowood station. We live in Steele Creek so he has to drive to Arrowood by car. His plan is to park at the Arrowood Park and Ride station and bike from there to uptown. Is that even allowed since he is not actually riding the light rail??"

There used to be a grass field with a tree on it across from where District Flats is in Southend.  Now I saw that there is a construction site where they are doing excavation work.  Does anybody know what is going to be built here?  Usually new construction in Southend is highly publicized, but I haven't seen anything on this yet.
I was looking up the course online and saw it was only 9 holes. I've driven by a few times and have never seen anyone out there. Not a great golfer, but was thinking about going out this afternoon. Worth it?

"Hello all,I'm looking for a physiotherapist, preferably as close to Steele Creek as possible. I would like one that is used to working with athletes, however. I have some back issues that are sports-related and there are some exercises, like deadlifts, that I can't do anymore. Strangely enough, I can font squat but cannot back squat. It is partially mobility related but still have constant lower back pain due to previous sports-related injuries. I've noticed a lot of physiotherapists in Charlotte with good reviews but most of them tend to work with patients that were involved in accidents.Thank you in advance."
"Hi all, Did a quick search but turned up nothing in the sub.Anyone got a recommendation for 1 on 1 handgun lessons?

"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.  The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

They're about 2 miles apart, and we'd only need one way transportation to get everyone from A to B.

"Hello people of r/Charlotte!I've been trying to find an abuse support group (physical and emotional) in the area and have even looked on meetup, but can't seem to find anything.  I was wondering if anyone knew of any in the area that aren't gender limited.Otherwise, if I can't find one I would like to start one, but I do not know the way.  If anyone has any kind of information, either about one already here or where to start with creating one, I would really like the help.  If anyone is a therapist that would like to help create one or at least start me on the right path, I would be overly ecstatic about collaborating with you.I have been in 2 long term abusive relationships, one of which is current, and I just really need someone to talk to that shares my experience.  I've been to individual therapy and it just told me everything I already knew in the back of my head and it may seem easy to just say, ""Just end it,"" but it's not always an easy case.My goal is to create a community of support and allow those that may be struggling with abuse or the after effects of abuse to share their story and feel connected to others so that they don't feel alone in their struggle.  I also want to be very cautious with how it's handled as well, I don't want to start a group and have the community lead itself down a path that it shouldn't or give bad advice.So, once again, if anyone is interested, knows of a group already in progress, or is a professional that would like to help create one for the area, I would enjoy the help.Thanks"

But the city is now home to one of the fastest growing tech sectors in the United States, with a blossoming start-up scene and major research universities augmenting an already buoyant economy.The number of high-tech jobs in the city grew 33.2 percent from 2013 to 2015, up from 18.6 percent from 2012 to 2014, according to a survey by real estate company CBRE. Charlotteâ€™s growth was the second-highest improvement among the 30 markets surveyed by CBRE.â€œThe tech talent pool in Charlotte has grown by nearly 75 percent since 2010,â€ù says Mike Fahey, Charlotte-based CBRE senior vice president.An expanding tech sector, aided by a period of historically low interest rates, is sending property prices in Charlotte higher and fueling a record building boom.More than 12,300 apartments are in the pipeline in Charlotte with another 13,500 in the planning stages, according to research firm Real Data.

Happy (early) Valentine's Day /r/Charlotte! It's time for another brewery meetup to celebrate the one thing we all love, a good craft beer and food truck! This week we'll be heading over to [Sugar Creek Brewing](http://sugarcreekbrewing.com/), home to my personal favorite fruit beer in Charlotte, the Raspberry White Ale, 2016 U.S. Open Beer Championship Gold Medal Winner! Sugar Creek plays home to a [great selection of regular and seasonal beers](http://sugarcreekbrewing.com/beer/sugar-creek-seasonal-and-year-round-craft-beer/) many of which are award winners. Where OMB last week focused on German beers, this week at Sugar Creek we get a brewery more focused on the styles of the Belgian Trappist monks, a style famous for it's deep and unique flavors. To sate your appetites while enjoying the beers, Sugar Creek will be playing home to my favorite food truck simply for their excellent Taco Tuesdays, [The Tin Kitchen](http://www.tinkitchenfoodtruck.com/truck-menu) (the Pork Belly Taco is to die for!). Also on Tuesdays at Sugar Creek is Trivia Night, so come prepared for some Valentine's themed trivia (and on good authority possibly cupcakes). Hope to see you all there!

I currently have a membership at Planet Fitness and I go to the one in the Whitehall area off of South Tryon.

Fairly new to the city and have an antique upright double bass that I'm looking to sell/put up for consignment. I've done some research online but it seems like there isn't a large market for selling used orchestral instruments in Charlotte.

Hey guys, was trying to get some opinions on two general locations in charlotte to rent an apartment. My fiancÃ© and I are both in our late 20's moving from Pittsburgh.

We like apartments in both area's but need help on the "better" location. Thank you.

To be absolutely frank, I'm not even sure if I've found anything of worth as I'm still unsure about pyrites versus gold. I've done tons of reading about it, it's just hard for me to tell if it's actually a fleck of Au or another damn pyrite, mainly since I haven't yet found anything that stand out as 'Yep, that's definitely gold.'.

Hey there everyone! After a sad Super Bowl Sunday for Panthers fans everywhere, I think it's about time for another brewery meetup! We'll be heading over to [Olde Mecklenburg Brewery](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/) this week. Probably the best known of the breweries in Charlotte, OMB stands by a philosophy of following the German beer purity law (Reinheitsgebot in case you were wondering), which means any beer from OMB will only consist of three general ingredients: water, hops, and barley. Thanks to this the [beers](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/beer/) on tap are all clean versions of their respective styles. Don't let that put you off though, with 10 years under their belts OMB hasn't survived this long with sub-par brews, the flavors are excellent and pair incredibly well with the [German-style food](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/brauhaus/#menu) offered in the brauhaus. I hope you can all make it out to *the* quintessential Charlotte brewery and I look forward to raising a glass with you all! 
"[North Charlotte, University Area, Huntersville/Cornelius/Davidson]I very much believe it's part of my social contract obligation to contribute some time and effort to help other people.

I haven't had a regular gig in years, and that needs to change.My employer lists thousands of possibilities, and I bounced around with some Hands on Charlotte leads years ago. Way, way too much. I'm overwhelmed to the point of confusion every time I even try to look.I happily worked many hard and long hours as a high school band booster when I had kids in the system, but they've all moved on. And booster clubs are like PTAs in that if you don't have a kid involved, the best reception you can hope for is ""a little weird"".But I do like working with young adults and kids on the cusp, say 16-25 years old. I also love food and cooking. What I'd really like to find is a situation where I could teach/coach/encourage young folks about the subjects.

This bill is dangerous for patients and may pass if you don't speak up!1 out of 3 people do not know the difference between an Ophthalmologist (medical doctors) and an Optometrist but the differences are huge! Do you want someone who didn't go to medical school performing surgery on you or your loved ones?Optometry schools (four-year programs focused on optics to prescribe glasses and contacts and the diagnosis and management of certain eye-related diseases) have a tough application process, but nobody ever really faces a clear-cut choice of going into optometry or ophthalmology. Even if you do exceedingly well in medical school, you could easily miss out on an ophthalmology residency slot. Ophthalmology is among the most selective specializations in medicine.Please contact your state representatives today! Don't know who they are?

I'll likely have family down next Friday for lunch. As my dad is a big craft beer guy, I'd like to take him to one of the local breweries, but not all are open during lunch, or have limited menus. What's the best combination for both local beer and a decent lunchtime menu?

"A month or two ago I started getting coupons in the mail about a new inspection station. I hung on to the coupon since I knew I needed an inspection and went over on my day off. It was a tiny little place, one garage with an attached waiting room. Guy at the station was real friendly, said I could keep my coupon because they were doing a grand opening spring promotion. I go to the waiting room and watch him work. Cool set up, they've got multiple cameras and monitors so the one guy can look all around the car at once. I was out in probably 10 minutes for a grand total of $25. Cheapest and fastest inspection I'd ever done.Now two weeks later my wife needs an inspection. I lost the coupon and can't remember for the life of me exactly where the place was or what it was called. I'm sure it was on South Blvd, I want to say near either Tyvola or Park Road. The place had a real generic name, inspection was in the title. It's not an auto shop or anything, they do nothing but inspections. They're quite new and I don't think they had a website or anything.Anyone else been here or seen the coupon? Would love to have the name and/or address."

I dig fitness type stuff like hiking, although I would in no way describe my self as fit, I just enjoying getting out with the dog. I like adventures and collect magnets from each new city that I visit. I'm not a heavy drinker and don't live downtown, which is why I've avoided the brewery scene for the most part so far. I am 420 friendly but that's not really something I like to base friendships on, kind of the ties that bind but not the main tether. While I appreciate any suggestions you may have for how to meet people, that's not really why I'm posting. I'm kind of just looking for a group of like minded chick friends here with similar interests. I, very naively, looked for any options of friendship when I first moved here, leading mostly to men and it turns out people are not as kind or respectful as I thought or had hoped. So I think I really am looking for other ladies unless you, a male, come with an awesome wife who also wants a friend.  If any of this sounds like you or you have found yourself in the same boat, please feel free to message me!

My fiance and I are going to Crowders Mountain to walk Crowders Trail and were thinking about bringing our dog. He is a 2 year old dog who routinely goes on long runs and walks with us, so he is pretty active. However, these are just walks and runs on flat and well maintained surfaces like sidewalks or roads. I was just curious if any one has an opinion on how the terrain is along the trail and if there is any areas that would not be easily accessible for a dog? Or if anyone has had a similarly active dog and walked the trail and their dog had a difficult time with the distance of the trail (2.8 miles one way)?

For context, I want to get my boyfriend a piece of art for our anniversary - we live in Charlotte and had our first date at a brewery, so even an interesting photo of a brewery could work. A while back, NoDa Company Store had some paintings that were of NoDa and Plaza and while they weren't photos or quite my taste, the subject matter was what I was looking for.  I know I could just go to all of the breweries and other places that feature local artists and have small galleries but I wanted to try here first and see if anyone knew some websites and/or places that may have what I'm looking for.

Just need to get it finally legally done. Please let me know if you can help! Edit: I've decided to go with John Walker, who seems to have it very streamlined and efficient.

This is a long shot but running out of options. I am a current Clinical Mental Health Counseling student who is out of state looking for a practicum and internship site in the Charlotte area (also willing to drive up to an hour or so).

I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of a private practice or organization that willingly accepts Counseling interns. Direct contact information is much appreciated. Thanks!

"Hey Charlotte,My Cohost and I moved to Charlotte from various parts of the nation. We created the Why Not Perspective as a means of motivation to get out and explore our new home here in Charlotte. In discovering our home, we became aware of the need for our realizations as to where to go, how to make friends in a city that you have no friend group in, and ultimately how to embrace where you are with open arms and grow to love it as â€œHomeâ€ù. Considering over 16k of us have gathered on this reddit, we wanted to make you aware of our existence. While we are new to podcasting, we foresee this podcast being a real asset to those moving to Charlotte. Summer months tend to be high traffic times with new graduates moving to their first post grad job and city. Weâ€™re hoping that we can begin to generate awareness before then ensuring that this information is available to those who may most need it. Please visit our website at HTTPS://www.TheWhyNotPerspective.com for our podcast and future blog posts of bars, restaurants, and activities. We'd love for you to join us on this journey!Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheWhyNotPerspectiveTwitter: @TheWhyNotPerspectWebsite: https://TheWhyNotPerspective.com"

"There's a property that the city owns on the East side of the city that NO ONE knows what to do with (Eastland Mall). It's a diverse, yet poor neighborhood. All other plans for the site have fallen through and it remains essentially a parking lot.I don't have kids. But I do have a vested interest in education. We all do. We need to make sure we have an economically and culturally flourishing society for the years to come. I have major, major problems with the direction of education over the last 100 years.We have and continue to raise kids to learn four subjects (Math, English, Science and sometimes History). We say this is what time you show up. This is what you wear. Listen to your teacher/boss. We raise generation after generation of worker bees and lament the lack of creativity. Of course we're not a creative society -- we have stifled it out of the most creative individuals in our society -- the children!We start asking kids at 5 years old, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" This is a one dimensional question. No wonder no one can answer it even as adults. There are a very few people who grow up knowing they want to be a firefighter. Most of us stumble through school, college and our careers looking for something that instills passion.We do not expose children to enough subjects. If we teach personal finance, aren't we teaching math with it? If we teach how to build a bicycle, don't they need to learn physics and pi? How can we continue to over-test, over-work and stress out these great, budding minds and not take the time to shepherd them to find an inner passion? How can we possibly train children for a work force when we don't have any idea what that work force will look like in 5 years, let alone 20?Steve Jobs dropped out of college, yet remained on campus wandering from class to class and just looked for subjects that interested him. One of those subjects was calligraphy. Hardly a useful skill. Until you're building a personal computer and decide that you're going to invent fonts.The next generations won't be excelling in singular fields. They'll be marrying AI with cooking. Robotics with surgery. Instead of teaching four subjects, we need to teach 400. Learn how to cook, how credit works, entrepreneurship. Teach dance, painting, civics. Find and instill a passion for learning no matter what the subjects are.We don't need an education evolution. We need an education REVOLUTION.So I'd like to propose (to anyone that listens) that Charlotte develops this Eastland Mall location to be a world-class education campus. Funded by private means because, once again, we all have a vested interest in the next generation.-We need to stop gating our adult education behind community colleges and universities. We should offer adult education and vocational training 52 weeks of the year. It should be 100% free and not time-gated by semester. We should offer classes on personal finance, English and Spanish as a second language, cooking and parenting while also training plumbers and mechanics. Come and take classes when you can.-We should use a severely under utilized asset as teachers -- senior citizens. We have millions of them in this country willing to volunteer and they have something to teach us all. Seniors need to pass on the education and PASSION they have. We will shuttle them onto campus or beam them in through Skype.-We should have a research center whose only mission is to find, cultivate and implement any tool that will make education easier and more effective.-A K-12 public school on campus that believes in thinking outside the box and restores emphasis developing individual passion in order to instill a lifelong thirst for more knowledge.To reiterate, any class you want to teach and we'll find a room for you to teach in. Any class you want to take will be 100% free and you're welcome anytime. All lessons get posted online for free viewing. We will teach you and your child in the same class. We will offer child care for babies and toddlers while parents are in class. We will educate work skills as well as life skills. Your children will go to school and be exposed to enough subjects that we will find their talents. Teachers will become shepherds of passion.We will, in short, create a better society. How could anyone be opposed to this?Wait, was this supposed to be 140 characters?"

Sorry for the late post, but was wondering where I could watch the sunset from charlotte or a nearby area. We have an hour! :)
Hey, So I am visiting Charlotte in April book ending a business trip to High Point.  I'll have a Thursday night and a Sunday night in town and seeing what the best spots those nights are.  Staying downtown near the epicenter on Thursday April 20th. 
Those are two things I kinda want to do, and I just got to Charlotte from a small city. Anything like this within a 50 mile radius? Also bonus points for the Karaoke to be not mostly Asian music, although I know private room karaoke is almost exclusively an Asian affair.

I've lived in an Apartment in southpark for a few years now and have always had abysmal internet with U-verse and after a few calls to see whats going on and being shrugged off I NEED to find a better provider. I live with 2 other people and were all constantly play games and streaming and were getting nowhere near the speeds we pay for.
Anyone going? Anyone know of any good after parties?
Don't forget about meat pies or pizza pies!
Happy Pi Day everyone! It's time for another brewery meetup! This week we're heading back to perennial favorite [Flight Beer Hall](http://flightclt.com/). With [91 different taps](http://flightclt.com/beers-on-tap/), Flight offers the best chance in Charlotte to try beers from around the state and country. With only 14 of those beers from somewhere other than NC or SC, there is sure to be something from a brewery you haven't tried on tap! Flight supplements their expansive beer list with a great [menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) that I still have yet to try anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy! Hope to see you all out there for every mathematician's favorite holiday!

"I'm an architect, I only moved here in August. And Ive been painting a lot and been doing some geometric graphic prints in my free time, and was thinking about trying to get gallery space now that my collection is growing. My paintings aren't of things, they're kinda abstract. Idk, I think they're good. I guess I'd need to start going to galleries to figure out where meshes best with my style.Anyways, does anyone know how to go about getting gallery space somewhere? Or just know of places that would be open to hosting a nobody, either for like an open event, or what an artist would do in general to get work out in public for the first time?My Instagram is @e_h_k_s but it's mostly just the graphic prints I've been doing. It's hard to take good photos of paintings on an iPhone. Hence why I want the real things to be somewhere in public. "

Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really.

We've also been checking out Cotswold, Meyers Park, etc. Our money doesn't seem to go as far, but the schools (as I understand) are much better, so would seem like a better value (and resale) in the end. On that topic, any good resources for learning about schools in Charlotte?Thanks!"

Hey there everyone! Sorry for the missed couple of weekends, but we are back with another Saturday meetup! This weekend we're heading over to [Kit's Trackside Crafts](http://www.tracksidecrafts.com/) in Pineville. A tap room and bottle shop, Trackside offers 23 different taps with a variety of styles from fruit ciders to imperial stouts and everything in between! Combine the taps with the bottles they have for sale and this makes more an excellent meetup for beer aficionados as well as those just trying to get in to the beer world! Trackside will be playing host to [Buffalo's Best Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/Buffalos-Best-Food-Truck-913307838706820/) for food, so look forward to some excellent fare straight from Buffalo, NY!

So all you charlotte vegans and dairy free folks, the ABC Store at 9500 South Blvd just got their truck in and have the almond milk Bailey's. The guy I talked to said most stores in the area should be getting it, it just depends on their truck schedule.
Compared to my previous state the liquor stores here are very expensive, and Costco doesn't have ABC sections. Do you guys have any recommendations?
"Wanted to see if I was the only one who noticed this.  Have been a Uber user before UberX on the West coast and am a pretty frequent user here.  Up to about 6 months ago the drivers were awesome.  Cars were clean and new.  Now...not so much.  Of my 5 or 6 most recent trips only 1 has been of higher standards.  My last ride had an older mini van that sounded like it was falling apart and had so many air freshers that I got a headache from a 10 min ride.  Before that had a guy who was so tall and in such a small car that the drivers seat went all the way back.  Would have been impossible to get a 2 rider in the back seat, let alone, the 3 that would be needed to allow for 4 passengers which is the standard.  Didn't help he was playing death metal either.  Also had a guy who went off on a crazy rant that was pretty out there politically.  My wife and I just kept saying 'ok' for the entire ride.  It is what it is.  UberX is super affordable and convenient and I'll continue to use.  It's just previously I used to tip on min fare rides or really cool driver.  Now...have no issue not tipping.  Just wanted to see what others think."
I have a full-time job but I want to supplement my income by being a driver part-time. How's the culture here for the most part?

Hey there everyone! This week we're heading back down to Matthews for [Seaboard Tap Room](http://carolinabeertemple.net/1017). The brewery they are planning on site is not open quite yet (should be early summer) but in the meantime Seaboard offers an excellent chance to taste beers from around the world in a wide variety of styles. In addition, for those of you who have significant others or friends who are not huge fans of beer but have wanted to bring them to something like this, Seaboard is also a wine bar meaning that more than any other meetup on our normal rotation there really is something for just about everyone at Seaboard! For food there is a ton of places within a 4 or 5 minute walk to grab to-go from, Seaboard is situated in the middle of historic downtown Matthews. As such there is no parking lot specific to the tap room but there is plenty of road parking. I hope to see you all there!

What's the gaming scene like in Charlotte? I'm doing some research, thinking about opening a gaming lounge/Internet cafe but I'm not sure if anyone would show.

I bought my tickets super fast as soon as they were announced. Surprised there was no sell out. Anyone else excited? I saw them in Raleigh and idk if its a Raleigh thing, but people were such assholes. 35 year olds on their phone the whole time, people pushing their way to the front,  and some drunk dude tried to fight me. I've had great experience with Charlotte shows, so I have faith the crowd will be excellent.

Hi everyone, it's been almost ten years now since Kyle went missing. This is a case that has always baffled and interested me, and I feel now is as good of a time as any to try and shed more light on what really happened to Kyle. I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone here that could provide more insight, first hand accounts, or information about the state of Charlotte at the time. Bartenders/Bouncers who worked at Buckhead's Saloon, employees of the Fuel Pizza at that time, friends who knew Kyle, or even a CMPD officer who could shed more light as well. Any and all input is welcome, and if I get enough sources or interest, my next step will be reaching out to the family to respectfully ask their permission to cover this topic. Theories are also welcome, too. Thanks in advance for any help!

"I bought a highly intelligent German Shepherd about 5 years ago. Plain and simple, he's a working dog. Unfortunately because life, I don't have the time to work with him how I used to. Because of this, he's suffering in my opinion. He's anxious, and hiss lack of ""work"" is driving him nuts. I'm not sure what to do with him, honestly. My heart doesn't want to rehome him but realistically it's the best option. I travel once / twice a month for a week at a time. My wife doesn't have the same bond with the dog so that's not much of an option to pawn him off that way. So here's the deal, if someone is interested in a dog, I'd be willing to have a conversation and meet up.

So I went to get a pizza at pizza peel tonight(by the way, the secret pizza menu is amazing, how have I not heard of this before?). Anyways, I parked in that huge lot in front of Elizabeth billiards and was away from my car for an hour tops. Came back and a 27 dollar ticket was on my window. What is up with this shit? I think I'll just ignore it, what do you think?

A few weeks ago I found on my windshield a parking ticket from Park It! Charlotte. The thing is, my car was parked in my spot at my apartment, and the parking violation was "improperly parked vehicle" (whatever that means). I spoke with the property management and they told me they never gave Park It or anyone else permission to ticket on their property. I looked it up online however and it seems like a legit parking enforcement company that is working with the city of Charlotte. I tried to appeal online and it was denied. The only way to appeal in person or phone is to pay a depoit (that happens to be the amount of the ticket). If they deny that final appeal they keep the money. My instinct is that this is BS and they can't do anything, but I hate the thought of an unpaid ticket hanging over my head. Any advice?

"I rent a house from a property management company (I won't post their name just yet) and Friday night my girlfriend and I left the house and locked the deadbolt just as we always do. We return at around 12:30am and unlock the deadbolt but the doorknob wont open. [this kind](http://casaveneracion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/front-door.jpg). We do not have a key to the side door so we are officially locked out. I call the ""emergency"" maintenance line about 20 times leaving 2 voicemails, as well as called the company itself. No answer. So I called a locksmith and he came and got in the side door for us. This is when I found out the doorknob is just flat out broken. It will open the door from the inside but won't budge at all on the outside. So I get charged $192.50 for the locksmith. Sunday night (44 hours later) the emergency maintenance guy calls me and says ""Are you still locked out?"" He was sick all weekend and forgot his phone in his car. So anyway, the maintenance guys come on tuesday and wind up putting an entire new door knob on the door because ours was so old they couldn't find the parts to fix it. They also give us 2 keys to the side door.Now, the property manager is telling us we will only get reimbursed partially for the locksmith, if at all,  and since we called after hours they would've charged us anyway. (why? I don't know. But they shouldn't charge me for something that they failed to do in the first place.) Also she told us that it was ""on the tenant to maintain the property."" So am I officially out $192? How can I fight this? I could understand if we locked ourselves out, but we didn't, it was failure of the doorknob which is part of the house we RENT. How is a doorknob giving out considered maintaining the property and fall on a tenant?Sorry for the rant but I'm very upset with this and can't understand any of their logic."

"Our Court of Appeals has 15 judges. We just passed a law to shrink it to 12. Why? Because three of them are hitting the age of mandatory retirement soon and Gov. Cooper would be allowed to appoint their replacements.That's it. That's the whole reason.There was abundant evidence presented to the legislature that the Court of Appeals has a heavy workload and this bill will slow down the disposition of justice in our state, but the bill was quickly passed despite these warnings.Notably, the last four Chief Justices of our state Supreme Court Justices - a bipartisan group - all strongly opposed the effort.Here's the most remarkable part: The move was so extreme that it compelled one of our judges on the Court of Appeals who was approaching mandatory retirement - and is a conservative Republican - to resign his seat in protest of the law and thereby allow Gov. Cooper to appoint a replacement.As he said, â€œI did not want my legacy to be the elimination of a seat and the impairment of a court that I have served on.""Gov. Cooper vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden by the GOP supermajorities that currently exist in both chambers.

I work very near the Overstreet mall, so I'm familiar with the offerings there, but what are other nearby options (can include places in Epicenter)? I'm specifically looking for places where I can easily order to go (preferably online), rather than sit down. I typically bring my own lunch but having options when I'm either lazy or wanting something different would be nice.

Hi, I live in Camden, SC and have been in contact with a Redditor in Charlotte. I have an excess of ostomy medical supplies that they are in need of. Currently I don't have a way of getting the supplies to them outside of just mailing them. If someone is from this area and is heading up to that region, maybe we can make this work. Hit me up as soon as you can and hopefully we can make this happen. Thanks!

I've noticed an increased amount of people riding in gangs of unmarked ATV's and dirtbikes...especially near plaza midwood and North Davidson. I'm curious if anyone else is noticing this activity, and if so what we can do about this. I've seen them flaunting guns and other weapons, even pointing them at citizens. This is not good for our community and we need to do something about it. Currently I don't think cops are pursuing them, similar to a law that allows illegal riding in Washington DC. I figure reddit would be a good open forum to try to figure out how to clean this up. At the bare minimum we need to be calling 911 and reporting every single incident to raise awareness. 
"Hi r/charlotte! I don't post on reddit often, but i'm a pretty big lurker and have been searching for an answer to my specific dilemma here with no certain answer. I'm 23, and from Philadelphia, PA. I grew up in the 'burbs here and graduated from college this time last year. I moved to the city to be more successful in school and in my social life, and I still feel like it isn't everything I anticipated. A few years into living here, I realize that I'm not really headed down any particular career path, though I've always been into music (a lot of psych/rock/indie/electronic stuff to put it vaguely), drawing and writing.  Philly's not great as far as paid job opportunities go, so after school I got into nannying, which has been good for a creative type like me - something to just pay the rent and not a depressing office job.Fast forward to now: a year after graduating school, me realizing that I can't really keep up this lifestyle forever - working, paying the rent, taking small trips here and there but not really giving myself room to grow in finding a career, building relationships outside of the world I know or setting long-term goals in general. I have the opportunity to move to a Charlotte suburb with my family later this summer, but I'm hesitant to commit to it fully because I don't know what I'd actually be doing there. I know I want to get out of my element and make new friends. Philly often feels small to me and at concerts, parties and other events I always feel like I know most of the people there (in a claustrophobic kind of way).  I'm worried that I'll have trouble finding likeminded people in Charlotte, even though I realize there are a lot of transplants like me. I'm not big on religion, sports, or drinking. I know that there is at least some kind of art and music scene in Charlotte, which is a big draw for me, but I have no idea what the nature of it really is or how to get involved. Here, art and music are a pretty big deal but I feel a little bit stagnant having gone to the same venues and scenes for a few years. I plan on staying in Charlotte for a while and feeling it out, but I'd like some pointers on what kind of art/music clubs and communities are most open to newcomers. Here, most of the people my age hang out at house shows or in bar-type venues where a lot of varied music acts come through. Where's most like that in Charlotte? In Philly there's a facebook group for just about every community - people who put on diy music shows, art folks, lgbt groups, women who bike, mom groups (comes in handy because I'm a nanny), philly photographers, and all kinds of groups for specific neighborhoods. Are there specific groups like that for Charlotte? Or maybe just one general group besides reddit that I could start to get a more personal feel for an online community? I'd like to work as a volunteer, work part-time as a nanny and potentially work another part-time job where I'd be likely to meet creative and easygoing people like myself. Is there a neighborhood that would be good to look for jobs in? I'd like to do something like work at a vintage clothing shop, or a book/ record store. Just somewhere semi-creative that I'd feel more driven to connect with people than to get a huge paycheck.  Where would be a good place to start looking for a job like that?A huge part of why I'd like to move is for cheap rent to live with family, because of the weather and green-ness of the environment â€” there's not a lot of that around here except for some short months in the spring and summer. I love the possibility of taking day trips to Asheville, so yeah, the nature stuff is really appealing to me and to some extent the potential to isolate myself from a bunch of noise/other people if I want or need it.  I also have a dog, and I know that he'll be a lot happier to have more green space. But I'm not totally sure where to go from there with helping myself grow. Sorry if any of this seems stupidly naive. I'm like 75% decided that I'm going to move, but I know I still have a lot of research to do. Help a gal out?TL;DR: 23 yr old Philly native feeling stagnant, moving to Charlotte. Looking for ways to become involved with the art/music/creative scene and to get a feel for the community in and around Charlotte so that I'm not clueless when I get there. "

"Hi /r/charlotte, this is a throwaway account.The backstory is that my mother had a stroke a year ago and her entire right side is paralyzed. She's recovering well, but I moved here to assist her. We got an apartment with Tricon American Homes and have had relative ease with them. Last week, on the 18th we received a letter that informed us effective the next day (the 19th) that Tricon would no longer be our owner/property manager. Our new owner/manager would be contacting us shortly. Weird, but ok.Today, at about 2:30PM our water was disconnected out of the blue. Now, Tricon had previously covered the water per our lease.  After calling the water company and our old property manager, Tricon, it was discovered that after the 19th, Tricon stopped paying the water service after the 19th. The new property manager seems to  be a shell company located in Florida, and they have no listed phone number associated with their company. Interestingly, the land company in Charlotte lists Tricon as the property owner since 2015.So, my disabled mother has no water service in her apartment, the only person that can connect the water is the new property manager, the new property manager is a shell company with no phone number or person to contact.What do."
"I will be working in the dead center of uptown Charlotte. I think I've found a place off of pineville matthews. It fits my price range, and the neighborhood is great considering that I have a kid.

Is the pineville-matthews part of charlotte completely separate from the urban feel of ""Charlotte""?  Would you feel comfortable with the same commute?"

Turn signals should be used when changing lanes and turning onto a different street. Please make yourself and others aware of the stick that is typically attached to the steering wheel in your vehicle. If this 'stick' is located on the right side of your steering wheel gently push the stick in an upwards direction prior to turning or changing lanes to the left side of your highly technologically advanced vehicle, and push downwards when you must go right. If you find the stick on the left side then following these directions only up and down will be opposite for right and left turns and lane changes. This is a very sophisticated procedure I understand, but practice will make perfect.
I'd love to go try out the various switches to see what I like. I know Best Buy has some.

But, its seems Charlotte drivers also enjoy destroying the environment. Literally, I watched someone open their door at a stop light, casually put a plastic bag with trash on the ground, look through it to make sure their trashy selves didn't leave something behind, and then shut the door. WTF? Seriously, what is that about? I took a picture of their car and them doing it. Is there a way to report this type of behavior to get them into trouble? That is completely messed up and screws up the environment.

So I am currently in the Hyatt downtown near the arena. My phone is locked up in an evidence locker and I won't be able to retrieve it until 8 am. I was waiting for someone to send me some money through the cash app so I would be able to get a hotel but now I am stuck with $40 and no where to go until the morning. Anyone have any suggestions for what I can do to kill 8 hours?

"Just a quick bug question. Within the last 2-3 weeks I've noticed tiny Grey mites all over the house and patio. I actually noticed it when I put a box down for an hour or so on the patio and when I brought it inside, it was covered. Now I'm noticing them everywhere and they're just traveling from the patio onto the house siding. I tried to Google it but the only mite I'm really finding is clover mites which are red. These guys are Grey but about the same size. Are they just a younger clover mite or is it something to worry about? I can get you guys a picture but it's getting dark now. I just got home and noticed them on the house and wanted to ask while it's on my mind. Thanks guys! "

"Hi all.  Moved down to NC from NJ in January and I was looking to see if there was a similar group like the one I belonged to in NJ.  It was called the Freelancers Union [(https://www.freelancersunion.org/)] and the biggest benefit was ""group"" health insurance by pooling us all together.  It covered NJ & NY, I'm pretty sure PA and CT too.Unfortunately, I have to ask this dumb question because the Horizon Blue Cross & Blue Shield plan we currently have & pay $600/month for the privilege of not using, refuses to update my address, claiming they won't provide service, however, they've covered every doctor we've gone to so far.  Just went through the ACA marketplace and a lesser plan with a deductible of nearly $15,000 is just shy $900/month.What are other freelancers doing down here for health insurance?"

As many of you have noticed who have ever been to the Common Market, there is a homeless person who lives on one of the benches in the patio area. This person has been here for quite sometime and has set up shop with suitcases of clothes all around. I am surprised the owners haven't kicked the person out. It is quite the unique individual, who wears about 10 layers of clothes, constantly wears sunglasses, has a drawn-on mustache and has hair extensions that fold into his or hers shoes. From a business perspective, it's just a waste of valuable sitting space for people who are there to consume Common Market foods or beers; Jon Taffer would be pissed.  I can assume the owners are cool with it, and it doesn't bother me. I just want to know what the general conception was from the other patrons.
Hey there everyone! I'm incredibly sorry for the last minute post, I was very sick yesterday and didn't do much of anything. This week for the meetup we'll be heading to [Legal Remedy Brewing](http://legalremedybrewing.com/) home to the most eclectic [beer selection](http://legalremedybrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/beer-list.pdf) in our rotation. A first glance at their selection may make you think that they are just another ale brewery, but on closer inspection you start to notice main flavors like pineapple, strawberry vanilla, or even french toast. Unafraid to experiment with styles or flavors, Legal Remedy has quickly become a favorite of everyone who has made the trip.To complement their beers, the brewery offers an excellent [food menu](http://legalremedybrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/food-menu.pdf) that is definitely the best of any brewery we go to (their fried pickles are to die for). I hope everyone can make it out!

AC is busted.  I am pretty poor.  What is the best way to get a new AC unit.  My unit is r22 and almost 20 years old.  Been refilling it every couple years for a while now.  It is going to cost a lot to do it this time, probably better investment to put that towards a new unit.  Should I buy my own and just have someone install it?  Can that work?  
I'm buying a house but I'll still be under a lease for a condo for another four months.

"Dear Charlotte Drivers,You suck at driving. That comes at no surprise to an outside observer, but I realize your self-righteous self is incapable of self reflection and doesn't get the correct feedback on your horrible driving as much as drivers up north do. Mainly, due to the fact, that most drivers around here are too scared, or too much of a pussy, to use their horn and give you feedback you deserve oh so much. Up North, the horn has taught idiot drivers that they are, in fact, in the wrong.Some observations today on the road:* -Watched someone come to a DEAD STOP on the interstate to allow another MORON who doesn't understand that you are supposed to hit the accelerator when merging onto the interstate. No, driver who stopped on the highway, you are not being ""polite"" to the idiot who can't merge, you are being an asshole and risking the lives of others on the road because of your behavior by coming to a dead stop on the highway (where the speed-limit is 65+mph in that location). Also, NO, you were not in the right. You were in the wrong and will eventually possibly learn that when an 18-wheeler comes plowing through your car and kills you, because NO they can't stop like a car.Also, to the driver who can't merge onto the interstate, revoke your license (actually, both of you revoke your licenses). If you are incapable of properly merging onto an interstate, you have no business driving on one.* -I'm sure the one of the drivers above caused this, but thanks for helping cause an 18-wheeler to turn over and block ALL lanes of traffic on interstate 85. You turned a normally 30-minute drive into an hour and a half drive. Yes, I was in the wrong for not having my google maps on (to avoid the stupid accidents you cause 24/7 on the roads around here) because I assumed you idiots would take a day off from being stupid on the road. I was clearly wrong. * -Thanks for the rest of your stupidity. To the point that the passenger in the car, who is not originally from Charlotte (but does live here now), made the observation that you all are horrible drivers compared to other places.* -The only drivers who seem to trump you at sucking at driving are the cars with ""South Carolina"" plates in Charlotte. Sincerely, stay on your side of the border (at least with your cars, take an uber or something). We have enough bad drivers around in Charlotte, we don't need further support. You take it to a whole next level of poor driving. Also, you all are the few people on Earth who manage to CONSISTENTLY, go 10+ mph UNDER to speed limit.Anyways, just a concerned citizen letting Charlotte drivers know (and SC drivers in the area), you SUCK at driving and seem to not realize that. Again, this is a futile letter as the majority of you all are sincerely incapable of self-reflection and think all the above behavior is normal and everyone else is wrong to call you all out on it. But, no, it's not normal behavior.If you all are dead set on getting into a car crash, then please do so on a dirt road away from others. Total your car and don't buy a new one and get off the road please. Stop putting the rest of our lives at risk because you are incapable of learning how to drive and learning how to self-reflect that YOU may be in the wrong in how you drive.Sincerely,A concerned citizen who thinks you suck at driving and you need to GTFO the road.**EDIT: Feel free to downvote all you want. You can click a downvote button, but you can't downvote the truth. The letter is staying up. This is dangerous behavior and I'm calling it out for what it is.****EDIT 2: This link proves my point: https://www.charlotteagenda.com/44380/bad-charlotte-drivers-really/ .**>Waze actually listed Charlotte as one of the 10 cities were drivers were MOST satisfied. Their ranking was based on traffic, safety and the self-reported â€œmoodsâ€ù of Waze users.>Charlotte came in at No. 20 with a death rate of 9.8 for every 100,000 residents. Just ahead of New Orleans and significantly ahead of Atlanta. New York City was the safest by this measure (no surprise) followed by San Francisco.**Basically, my point was made with this article. Charlotte driver's are idiots. AKA, they are in great moods while driving (aka, oblivious to how stupid they drive). Yet, they rank as horrible drivers in real life (along with other southern cities, who are also horrible drivers).****This proves my point.****EDIT 4: Top controversial post on here right now. AKA, a lot of people upvoting and downvoting. AKA, a lot of people agreeing with my post and a lot of a-hole drivers who are mad they are getting called out and refuse to self reflect. Drop your ego and fix your driving, your putting other people's lives at risk with your poor driving.**"

I'm John Galt guys.Then I went to elevation church and gave them my $5, so it basically went straight to Jesus. Then I asked my boy Jesus for a south end starter pack but he just gave me a glock and bill for rent a center. "

I called the fence company that the neighbor used, and they said the neighbor knew it wasn't their property and I never gave permission for them to build there. I have a survey of my property already from when I bought the home. Should I hire a lawyer? Or go to small claims? Who would I even sue? The fence company for knowingly building on somebody else's property without permission, the homeowner that told them to do it, or both?UPDATE: The fence company just came out and they are moving the fence for free for the homeowner that told them to put it up. It'll be about a week until they fix it though. They'll also fill up the holes they dug with dirt. Should I still contact a lawyer? There was no grass in the area since it's behind my fence."

I am not going to kidnap anyone.There's a place called Silverwood.

Are the people friendly? Helpful? Is it calm, or a stressful city?I watched some videos on Youtube, and got the impression that the city was nice and tidy. Also very pretty, and I liked that. My own country doesn't have any big cities that fit what I needed for my story, that's why I decided to use Charlotte.If there's anything you'd like to tell me about the city or surrounding area, please do.

I'm sick of the traffic, the high cost of living, the transience of the people, and THE COLD. I hate winter more and more every year.I am a 29 year old female who is single and has nothing really tying me to Boston - my family lives in western MA but understands my desire to explore other parts of the country. As far as work, I've always had office/admin jobs (BA in English); not picky about where I work, as long as it pays the bills. I am a HUGE music fan (rock, alt rock) and go to a few shows a month. I do love the culture and history of Boston, along with the general beauty of the city, which draws me to Charlotte rather than somewhere like Atlanta or DC.I'm planning to visit Charlotte for the first time in May, with my mom. I'm curious about the neighborhoods, the job-search atmosphere, and the basic vibe of the city. Any feedback is welcome from my fellow beloved Redditors.EDIT: While I can appreciate the suggestions of other towns/cities, I'm pretty settled on the idea of Charlotte! If I decide to make the move out of Boston, that's really the only place I'm considering. Just posting here to get a feel for the city based on opinions of people who already live there."

Hey there everyone! It's time for this week's main brewery meetup! This week we're heading over to [Olde Mecklenburg Brewery](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/), Charlotte's most well known brewery. Gaining notoriety for their strict adherence to German beer purity law, the only local brewery to do so, OMB presents a selection of [beers](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/beer/) that are incredibly crisp and refreshing. Known best for their altbier, Copper, and their pilsner, Capt Jack, OMB offers a wide range of styles that should fit almost any taste. To go with their beer, OMB offers an expansive [menu](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/brauhaus/#menu), that I personally love. Overall, OMB is a great first meetup for anyone new and a favorite of returning members, so I hope to see you all there!

Hey there everyone! We've got another Saturday meetup finally! This week we're heading over to [Red Clay Ciderworks](http://redclayhardcider.com/) to try out some hard ciders. Open for nearly two years, Red Clay is Charlotte's oldest cidery, and has certainly earned their spot as one of the go to spots for any fans of cider in the area. Using all North Carolina apples in their [excellent array of ciders](http://redclayhardcider.com/cider), they still manage to coax flavors as diverse and distinct as you can find from any brewery. Not a cider fan? They have guest taps for local breweries as well as some wine offerings to meet your needs. I hope to see you all out for our first cidery to enjoy some excellent cider with great company!

However, my endeavors have hit somewhat of a wall as of late. The primary problem is that when I search for things like ""Digital Media"" and ""Communications"" on sites like Indeed or LinkedIn, I'm not getting a lot of good results.

"Hey all!I'm looking for a decent neighborhood to rent a house. My roommates and I aren't trying to spend too much so about $2000 plus or minus some is our price range. We need 4 bedrooms with preferably 3 bathrooms, although 2.5 is also acceptable.I'm having trouble finding decent neighborhoods within ~20 minutes of UNCC's campus however we are not opposed to a longer commute. Any help is appreciated!"
Any other solo hikers out there? Thinking of trying my first one tomorrow at Mcdowell Preserve.

Hey there everyone! It's time for another brewery meetup. This week we're heading over to [Legion Brewing](http://legionbrewing.com/) in Plaza Midwood. Probably Charlotte's most popular new brewery, Legion's name spread quickly as a brewery not only putting out some [excellent beers](http://legionbrewing.com/beer/), but for hiring people who really knew their beer to work their taps as well as to brew. I usually like to take a second to highlight a style that each brewery specializes is, but Legion is a bit special. You will find your IPAs, stouts, and lagers, but also on tap are rarer styles like kuyt and schwarzbier. A perfect brewery for those looking to expand their style range, a flight at Legion is sure to show you something you haven't tried before. To go with your beer, Legion has recently added an excellent menu (which is unfortunately not yet on their website) sure to sate your appetite! Hope to see you all there!
I'm contemplating installing a pool.  I don't need anything fancy, just a pool, most likely fiberglass.  I know pools can get pricey if you want fancy patios/landscaping, etc.  I'm wondering how much just for a basic pool?  I saw an advert last summer for $25K from a local dealer, but I'm assuming it's for a tiny pool.  Anyone price out/install a pool recently, and what do the prices look like locally?  Thank  you!
Wondering if any of you have had any luck or know who to recommend? I know what I want, what tile etc, I just need someone to do the work for me. The bigger flooring companies I've contacted are trying to charge a ton for a relatively small job.

"So, I have noticed that in the USA (and especially in Charlotte), most apartments are built out of wood/sticks. This, is cheap building material, and in many other countries they don't build with this material because it sucks. You can hear everything your neighbors do especially with this apartment, where as concrete build helps prevent that.At this point, I'm sick of wood framed apartments. I'm looking for a solidly built apartment, made of concrete, that makes it near impossible to hear my neighbor.What apartments exist like this in Charlotte? I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe every apartment is wood based.Seriously, I need an alternative because I have lived in apartments for 3-4+ years in Charlotte and EVERY neighbor eventually ends up sucking. At this point, I have given up on my hopes of humanity, where people act respectable to each other, and would rather concrete deal with others inconsiderate behavior.Can someone please provide me a good list for this?Thanks for any help.PS: No, I don't want to buy a house. I don't necessarily know yet if I will be living in Charlotte in the long term and don't want to get locked down with a house right now. **EDIT:** See I am being downvoted. Guess people are big fans of crappy apartments. My bad, didn't realize Charlotte had a taste is bad apartment design. Just because you enjoy piss poor apartment design doesn't mean everyone does though."

"https://imgur.com/a/2MA9xSo I just bought this house that has a giant oak (? not sure) tree which has snapped off two massive branches.

The damn branch is a large tree on its own right. I'm hoping to harvest as much as I can and may attempt to fell it from the trunk of the tree. However due to the insane size I may need some professional assistance. So I guess I have several questions here:Can anyone recommend a tree service that can handle this job BUT being mindful of the fact that I want to specifically harvest this for lumber and not just cut it up into small pieces and haul it off?Anyone of you woodworkers have a mobile bandsaw that can cut this into some sweet planks after we have it on the ground?I would love to pick the brains of anyone who has experience harvesting fresh cut lumber like this. Happy to pay you in cash, beer of your choice, and/or some of this fine wood! I actually have some projects in mind for some of this but suspect it would need to be air cured for quite a while unless we were gonna run it through a kiln?Thanks!"

Hey everyone, my girlfriend and I are looking to move closer to the city and I was wondering where the best places to look would be. Our budget is 1200-1400 per month depending on how much we like the area/place. The kicker is that we have 2 dogs and it's not so much the breed restrictions that get us but the weight limits (one is 95 lbs), we have looked at all the popular sites (Trulia, Zillow, AppartmentFinder, etc.) and we have looked in all the popular areas (NoDa, Plaza, Uptown, South end, Dilworth, Elizabeth, etc.). This may be a shot in the dark but I was wondering if anyone knew of any places that might not be listed on popular websites that would be around or within the areas that I listed. Open to apartment rentals or house rentals. Thank you!

"What's up r/charlotteHad to create a new Reddit account for this, but I thought I'd share a new podcast me and a buddy started. I know there's been a ton of threads of people starting, or trying to start a local based podcast, and I know a few exist out there currently, but we wanted to make one with kind of a satirical spin on Charlotte living from our point of view.

Hello everyone! I am a professional choreographer, and was recently offered a position with a Korean entertainment company. (The exact company I can't specify, due to a non-disclosure agreement). Unfortunately, I decided to turn down the offer to focus on my education this semester. Now I am looking to submit official applications to some other agencies. My portfolio needs some more specifically KPop geared pieces; however, before I send it in. I am looking for some dedicated and talented dancers to help me film some choreo pieces to send off to agencies. You would have to be close to the Charlotte NC area. What's in it for you: You could be in dance videos being watched by industry professionals and leaders. I will include the names of dancers in the description of each video (As they are usually sent as unlisted YouTube videos) unless you request to be unnamed. Let me know if you would be interested!
"We all know 485 is a disaster in the rain. Today I was driving back from Columbia on 77 North, and the roads were absolutely fine. It was raining just as hard, if not harder, yet there was no accumulation of water. Then, you cross the state line and 77 becomes a sheet of pooled water. I merge on 485 and it only gets worse. Lanes aren't visible, and the water is just sitting with no movement.So my question: why do NCDOT roads not shed water? Is it a difference in materials? Did we award the bids to the shittiest contractors? It's like the roads are paved at a 0Â° grade with completely non-porous surfaces. "

"Hi everyone. I recently graduated and took a job working for a company in the Charlotte area. I did my research on them and everything seemed to check out just fine.

They are a rather small company which I thought might be good to work for. but in reality it is not at all what I was lead to believe nor what I expected. I am doing my part while on the job, but honestly there isn't enough work here to make it a 40 hour a week job even though I am working 40 hours, does that make sense? So, with that being said I am trying to network with other people in the Charlotte area that may know of a position available within the procurement, purchasing, buyer related roles. I am on Linkedin and I have been browsing Indeed in search of new opportunities.Does anyone have any other resources or direction that could point me in?

"The last several shows I've been to there this year, including last night's Ninja Sex Party show was terribly managed. Doors opened at 7 and there was still a line down the block to get in at 8:45. When I saw Run the Jewels a few months back it was the same thing. I've been to previous shows there that were sold out and the line never moved as slowly as it did at these past few, not even taking the nearly 2 hours some spent trying to get in. On top of that, security was super unfriendly. I waited by the ladies room for my girlfriend to come out and had a finger physically pressed in my chest and told pretty aggressively to move. I was nowhere near the stage for that to even be an understandable request. Just standing with the 8 or so other people waiting for their friends to come out of the restroom too.Does anyone else know what was going on or what's continuing to have this happen there or have had similar experience? I wasn't the only one complaining last night as I heard several people around me in line and in the crowd share similar stories.Other than the management of the concert the bands put on a wonderful show."

"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.

"**edit: Thanks so much to the people who confirmed that anyone is allowed to join the JCC! That's definitely what I'm going to do. I'm super excited; it looks REALLY nice. Thank you all again.**Hi all, I'm a girl and I live in a shitty neighborhood in east Charlotte. I moved here a few months ago (for my job, without knowing the area, unfortunately) from the safest neighborhood in the universe where I used to love to go jogging/running outside every night. That's not an option at all here (for reasons ranging from ""constant traffic/no sidewalk"" to ""creeping dudes, domestic disputes and drug use everywhere"") and it's slowly driving me insane. After a really uncomfortable encounter with one of the other residents here when I tried to go for a quick walk the other day, I decided I was done and needed to find an indoor track (also useful for when it rains since it seems to rain A LOT here). Unfortunately from googling it looks like there aren't any nearby except for the Albemarle YMCA, which closes before I get home from work and change clothes, the baptist church on WT Harris, which only lets church members pay to use their track (I asked, you can't just pay dues, you have to take a class with their pastor, publicly announce your faith in front of the congregation, agree to their ""church philosophies,"" etc. I'm a gay-as-fuck atheist, I just need somewhere to run), and the Jewish Community Center (word's still out on whether or not non-Jewish people can get membership for their gym facilities; it's been a couple of days and I haven't heard back from them). Is anyone else aware of any indoor tracks that don't close until around 9:30 or 10? If not, are there any other girls here in east Charlotte (not uptown, you know, the more outskirty parts) who go running at night, and if so, where??? I love running outside if possible but it seems like the parks all close at sundown too. If I have to I'll get a gym membership somewhere with treadmills, but it's REALLY not the same as actual running. :( It's making me super depressed not having a safe nearby place to run, since again I like to go every day and am not looking for an hour+ round trip (can't pay that gas bill, yo). Any experience/advice would be much appreciated, thank you so much in advance!!!"

"I've looked through old posts about gyms in Charlotte, and I keep running through and seeing Fitness Factory. Definitely my kind of vibe, but I keep reading that it's $60/mo for ""one side"" and $100/mo for ""both sides""? After looking through Yelp and Google, what sides differ from the others? Is one side classes?I basically want to be able to use all the equipment in the gym; the location isn't ideal, but it's super close to my work so I can pack a gym bag and just take it to the office (I just prefer to go home first and psych myself up for the gym, but I can always just not be lazy haha).I'm coming off about 3 years of losing all gym progress I've ever accrued, and I can't really start working out until beginning of June (I'm having my arm reconstructed), and just want something so I can look to set up a membership and maybe go ahead and start hitting leg days and cardio equipment before surgery.Alternatively, if anyone has gym recommendations in the Ballantyne/Pineville-Matthews area that isn't Planet Pizza(Fitness), that'd be great too!"

"I work nights so I am not used to any sort of morning commute. I live in Oakhurst, right at the corner of Monroe and N Sharon Amity. As of right now, 10pm, google maps on my phone says it's a 9 minute drive. I'm sure that will not be the case in the morning. I was hoping to wake up at 7am, take a quick shower and be on the road by 7:30, is it reasonable to give myself 30 mins to get there, get parked, and be where I need to be? Should I take Independence or Monroe? Any other thoughts or suggestions? Experiences? I'm not really freaked out, but it is slightly worrying me.Update if anyone cares: I arrived with plenty of time to spare. The lounge area while you're waiting to be called to a courtroom is pretty nice. There are TVs and they showed a morning movie (didn't catch the title, as was mostly on reddit on my phone) and an afternoon movie which was Total Recall and they made popcorn for everyone. There are vending machines, outlets for your devices which you're encouraged to bring, even laptops and shit. There is a quiet room, a locker room, a business room with desktop computers you can use, and upstairs there are friggin' arcade games and a pool table! All of this is amazing to me because I was summoned once before but in Winston-Salem, and we were allowed a book and had to sit on benches. Granted, that was 10+ years ago but still.yee"

Hey there everyone! This week we're heading back down to Matthews for [Seaboard Tap Room](http://carolinabeertemple.net/1017). The brewery they are planning on site is not open quite yet (should be early summer) but in the meantime Seaboard offers an excellent chance to taste beers from around the world in a wide variety of styles. In addition, for those of you who have significant others or friends who are not huge fans of beer but have wanted to bring them to something like this, Seaboard is also a wine bar meaning that more than any other meetup on our normal rotation there really is something for just about everyone at Seaboard! For food there is a ton of places within a 4 or 5 minute walk to grab to-go from, Seaboard is situated in the middle of historic downtown Matthews. As such there is no parking lot specific to the tap room but there is plenty of road parking. I hope to see you all there!

"I've been thinking a lot about how differences of opinion are amplified in online forums and social media, and was inspired by this recent [Heineken commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wYXw4K0A3g). It is far easier to ""hate"" someone whom you disagree with if you don't know that person. In my daily life, I am friends with, and often surrounded by, people of differing opinions, but we are friends nonetheless.We often live in bubbles, surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals and frequenting online forums and consuming news sources that reinforce our own predetermined opinions and bias. It becomes much harder to hate when you have a personal experience with someone whom you may disagree with, and having conversations with people with differing opinions can often lead to either you developing a more informed stance on a topic, or at least understanding why someone might feel differently that you. We are all unique, with different life stories and situations that shape our views. Often they are not right or wrong, just different.So, all that being said, I would like to extend an invitation to any users of this sub to tone down some of the inflammatory rhetoric and vitriol  by putting a human face on the ""opposition"". Users of this sub are essentially neighbors when compared to the country as a whole, and the world at large but we often don't act very neighborly.So the invitation stands...I would gladly buy a beer (or wine, or soda...whatever) to anyone who would care to sit down and discuss those differences in rational and reasonable manner. No name-calling, no abusive language or insults, just getting to know people with a different opinion and perhaps exploring why they feel the way they do.If anyone would be interested, send me a PM. We may not live near each other but perhaps at some point, we can take a little time to bridge the gap."

"I moved to Charlotte in January and just switched my South Carolina insurance to North Carolina Insurance.  By doing so my deductible doubled, my coverage was cut to a third of what it used to be,  there's no glass coverage (all SC comprehensive covers all glass on your car with no deductible), cost increased from 130$ a month to 157$ and North Carolina doesn't allow you to use Uninsured Motorist coverage on a hit and run.On Monday I was hit by a short ghetto woman (based on clothes and her spray painted car) who stopped, looked in my window while I was just waking up after being knocked out and then drove away. The cops came and said they would look for the woman but it's on me.  Now I have to pay 1000$ deductible to have my car fixed even though it wasn't my fault.  I don't know if this will raise my rates or not because Geico won't give that information when you call them (at least that is what I was told when I called this morning).I can probably fix the damage myself for about 600$ but still this is bull shit. My 19 year old brother was hit by a drunk driver who twisted my brothers truck and sent my brothers head through the back window and injured his back.  The driver ran away from the seen leaving his car and his girlfriend.  The guys insurance refused to pay my brother and the hospital sent him to collections ruining his credit.  Nothing happened to the guy for over year after the finally went to serve a warrant after multiple calls a day for the past 6 months where he was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and nothing else.These two expedience make me think the right thing to do is you're at fault is to just leave.  The lady that hit me will probably never get caught and the guy that hit me won't even have a traffic record.  But my brothers credit is ruined and Im out $500-$600.  "

"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.  The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

"Long story but I'll try to be brief, and answer questions.I'm the Treasurer on my HOA board of directors. We have 49 homes in our community. Some members of the community aren't happy with how violations and enforcement is being done. The board is receiving violation notices for thing such as, among other things: Commercial vehicles parked in driveways.This is very clearly a violation of our CC&R's (Covenants / restrictions).4 members of the board are voting to not enforce this. So they are selectively choosing which covenants to enforce, and which houses to send violations to and which not to. I'm the only board member voting to enforce this. But a lot of homeowners say they DO want it enforced.I've asked the board to use part of our legal fund to hire a lawyer to have any covenants amended that people want changed/removed, but they ignored my request.The HOA President is now trying to gather support from the community to remove me from the board (I'm 95% sure they won't get enough votes, I'm the only 1 on the board that seems to do anything). HOA President emailed me today and said ""The HOA is not a business, it's a community"" That should be proof she isn't handling her fiduciary duty to follow the covenants, because the HOA actually is a registered non-profit corporation.Is the board able to pick and choose which covenants they enforce? Should I hire a lawyer and sue the board to make them enforce everything as written?I started a petition today to remove our HOA President and I've gone door to door collecting signatures, our bylaws say we need 51% vote to remove a board member.I know most people here probably hate HOA's...so just don't buy a house in 1. But don't join one and then break all of the rules."
"I already have 4 lawyers for each particular nuance of the below issues and the individuals involved... I'm looking specifically to end the careers of the city officials responsible for making me hide in my closet and check all 5 of my new security cameras every time my door bell rings out of fear of being hauled off in the middle of the night, AGAIN, because we have retards that can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality in positions of power. And force the city to invest in even the most basic of automated background checks, and give their magistrates and judges the same Bullshit-o-meter training they give to our police officers, as they didn't believe any of their stories. But which is apparently so thorough, that they won't even take a physical evidence of a death threat against me seriously, because it's embedded in a 2000 character psychotic rant from arson suspect #2 that they don't want to deal with it, and assume shes the mother of my child or an ex lover that I'm seeking vengeance on.Twice these past 24 months, I've born witness to Charlotte magistrates and judges acting like 7 year old children, with a complete love of fairy tales, believing stories fabricated with absolutely ZERO evidence and exercising ZERO critical thinking skills. The results of this has been my 8 month old daughter being snatched to the other side of the country for a week and fucking hospitalized (I had to fly to Utah and form a sheriffs posse to retrieve her..... and it took 2 months for her to fully recover..), just hours before being evicted from my home with no one to care for all 3 of my pets.Fast forward several months, not 2 days after another hearing for custody, which was given to me again..My then 2 year old German Shepard/puppy and two cats are murdered in still open Arson investigation, because she was given un-supervised visitation(because kidnapping and filing false police reports isn't enough to warrant supervised visitation with her aunt in a quarter million dollar home down the street ....)So I had to transport her and my daughter 30 minutes away to stay in a 1 bedroom apartment shared by 3 adults and now a baby, and on my way back from dropping them off 30 minutes away, I get a phone call from the second arson suspect that my ex-wife set my house on fire before we left, and murdered all of my animals...And then a year later, I'm arrested while home alone while changing my now 2 year old daughter because the second Arson suspect (who sat in my driveway for 45 minutes while my house was on fire, after locking her cats and their litter box in her room and locking their cat door, and instructing some 8 year old neighbor's child to call 911 while she held her phone in her hand, and ran inside for half a second to inhale some smoke... A person with an active restraining orders against them, and who isn't allowed to see their children without court appointed supervision.. ) made MULTIPLE and finally a successful attempt at convincing one of the aforementioned retards, that I stole the medication for her mental illness over a year ago, because I refused to commit insurance fraud, and tell my insurance company that I was renting her a furnished room, and her past two attempts at suing me to replace her stuff were considered Nuisance claims.Fewer comments the better, I want to think about this as little as possible...PM me with the contact info of any blood thirsty lawyers."

"I've been seriously considering taking an immersive, full stack coding bootcamp for some time now, but I'm hesitant with the ones here in Charlotte. Has anyone graduated from one, or know someone who has? I've been looking at Coder Foundry and Tech Talent South specifically. I realize these bootcamps aren't a golden ticket to a high-paying dev job, but job placement is a huge factor for me when I'm paying $10K+ for any type of education. Assuming I leave the program with a good understanding and solid portfolio of work, is it worth it? I ask because it seems like there is a stigma with these programs. I've read how a lot of companies and recruiters don't even consider anyone with 'bootcamp' listed on their resume.Would love to hear any experience with Charlotte coding bootcamps - the quality of education and experience with jobs afterward."

"Link in case anyone is interested - https://www.charlotteagenda.com/89099/stake-school-boundary-decisions-hundreds-thousands-dollars-homeowners/Chalk this up to 'No Shit Sherlock'....but I did find this data from a Realtor pretty solid:> A market report for 4-5 bedroom, 2-4 bath homes between 2,500 and 3,000 square feet that had sales close in the last six months.  In the â€œdesirableâ€ù school district, the average sales price was $622,173, with homes selling in 52 days. In bordering â€œnon-desirableâ€ù school district, the homes went for $292,023, with an average of 62 days on the market.This is a massive spread of course but they also broke down something more specific:> Around Scaleybark Road, the Agenda found that a home sold last summer on Castlewood Road for $440,000, or $271 per square foot. A few months later, a similar home on the other side of the dividing line sold for $299,000 â€” just $158 per square foot.Even if you split the difference here that's $56.5 per square foot.  On a 2000 sf home that's $113,000 which is crazy.  Imagine being put upside down on your home due to a decision by the school board. Imagine the giant wrench this would throw into the tax base as I am sure these homes would be reassessed or challenged and their tax bill lowered.  "

So I did but then tried to walk back to tell my friend what was going on as they had told me to call whoever I was with. The large (3x my size) bouncer then cam charging at me like a football player, at which point I began to run but not to get inside just to get away from this very dangerous man. the last thing I remember is being put into a choke hold before I woke up in the hospital.

"North Carolina State Senator Jeff Jackson (u/jeffjacksonnc) is endangering women in order to promote himself by peddling a lie right here on Reddit about our right to withdraw consent to sex under current law.http://archive.is/hMXNbhttp://archive.is/LidaXhttp://archive.is/VhCpUhttp://archive.is/zOV3khttp://archive.is/2AfuLhttp://archive.is/jzyKdThis is a classic manipulation technique.  Someone creates a boogeyman with a lie and then presents themselves as the only person standing between the people and this supposed danger. Ignoring withdrawn consent to sex is clearly illegal under North Carolina's Kidnapping and Sexual Battery laws at the very least.  Some attorneys say that it is covered under rape statutes as well.  Yet Senator Jeff Jackson is peddling the lie that ""a woman cannot revoke consent to have sex"" under current NC law to promote himself and his legislation.This is extremely dangerous for women in NC and around the country because people might believe this lie and ignore a woman's withdrawn consent.  Furthermore, women might be even less likely to report a sexual assault because they think that it is not illegal based on what this guy is saying.  Please spread the word that a woman **does** have the right to revoke consent and that it is highly illegal under North Carolina's **current** kidnapping and sexual battery laws to ignore revoked consent.Here is a direct link to the statutes:http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_14/Article_10.pdfhttp://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-27.33.pdfEDIT:  The senator is now back-peddling slightly and has admitted that misdemeanors apply (http://archive.is/VZcKJ), however there is still a long way to go before the damage is undone.

He was born in the 50s and raised in Charlotte so he has way more knowledge than I do.I spent about 6 months obsessively developing the maps, brand, etc. This ultimately was the point... to make beautiful logos and maps.

"Session is about to end for the year, but there's something important I'm still working on and I'm hopeful we can get it done before we adjourn.North Carolina is the only state in the country where a woman cannot revoke consent to have sex once sex has begun. Sounds nuts, but it's true. It's from a 1979 court case called State vs. Way.That means if a woman initially consents and sex turns violent, she has no legal right to tell the man to stop and he cannot be prosecuted for rape - even if he admits that she had clearly withdrawn her consent.That means that a woman can say 'no' - but she can't say 'stop.' And that's clearly awful.Cases have been dismissed (or charges not brought) because of this court case, including at least one in Mecklenburg. There are some cases cited in the articles below, and I personally encountered this indefensible loophole when I was a criminal prosecutor. Fixing this has been on my to-do list since joining the state Senate.I filed a bill fixing this last session and had several Republican co-sponsors. It went nowhere. I filed it again this year and - again - it's gone nowhere.In my conversations with legislators, I haven't heard anyone who believes that women should not be allowed to withdraw consent. As a member of the minority party, it can be difficult to find out why some bills move and others don't.I'm still working on this. The reaction from the press in the last week has been very helpful in shining a spotlight on this glaring defect in our rape law. If and when this bill is allowed to come to a vote, I expect it will pass unanimously. Hopefully we can get it done this year, but if we can't, I'll try again next year. This really should be a non-partisan no-brainer.*****************Reference:North Carolina Legal Loophole Prevents Women From Withdrawing Consent to Sex http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/north-carolina-legal-loophole-says-women-can-t-withdraw-consent-n776026â€˜NC is the only state where no doesnâ€™t mean noâ€™: Law says women canâ€™t back out of sex http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article157694194.htmlOur View: â€˜Noâ€™ should really mean â€˜noâ€™ http://www.fayobserver.com/opinion/20170622/our-view-no-should-really-mean-noIn North Carolina, No Is Not Always No, If The Sex Has Already Started http://www.npr.org/2017/06/23/533947926/in-north-carolina-no-is-not-always-no-if-the-sex-has-already-started"

"My wife and I are considering relocating and Charlotte is currently one of the cities we are considering. We're getting rather fed up with Seattle and my wife quickly rejected my suggestion of looking at Texas and suggested Charlotte. A little background on us. We're both in our mid 20s, just had our first kid, I have an MBA from University of Washington and she has a Bachelors degree from there as well. I work in digital advertisement and make a fairly good living. She is a business analyst for an insurance company and makes ok money as well. While I say we live in Seattle we actually are about 25min north of the main city. Both of us have lived in WA since moving to the States (me 20+ years her 10+). We own a house and live pretty comfortably. Both of our parents live 10min North and South of us. I'm mostly Armenian and part Russian and she is 100% Russian. We've fully assimilated to US culture but still respect our background.We're Libertarian. I am a huge advocate for the Second Amendment, respect the Constitution, hate Communism and am fine with the legalization of weed (I prefer alcohol but to each their own). While WA and Seattle used to be fairly balanced with Left and Right wing nut jobs, its becoming too far left for my liking. More and more legislation is passing that I don't agree with and there is constant threat of diminishing my passion (shooting). The massive influx of Californians is only making it worse. It's very quickly becoming a place I don't want to raise a family in. We do love the PNW outdoors. We love to go hiking and camping together. I spend most of my weekend mornings fishing or going out to a shooting pit.My questions for Charlotte (or very close neighboring suburbs).-How do you like it?-What's the balance of political preference? I don't mind people of different opinion, I just don't like being the black sheep and having to constantly listen to my office berate my leanings.-How is the job market in Charlotte? Particularly around advertising or tech product management.-What's the NC firearm laws like? Concealed Carry? SBRs/Suppressors?-That said, hows the firearm community? I am fairly active on a popular gun forum here and have met some great people through it.-How are the public schools? -What areas around Charlotte are best avoided?-How are the outdoor activities? Hiking, fishing, camping? I also hate snakes and know there are some venomous species around there. How often do you encounter them?-What is there to do in or around Charlotte besides the outdoors?-Anything else you think is necessary or want to tell me is greatly appreciated!"
Hey there everyone! It's time for another Saturday Meetup! This week we're heading to [Thirsty Nomad Brewing](https://www.thirstynomadbrewing.com/home), a new brewery over in Olde Mecklenburg's neck of the woods! Only open a couple of months, Thirsty Nomad tries to brew a [wide range of beer styles](https://www.thirstynomadbrewing.com/whats-on-tap/) that leave me really excited to try everything I can! Unfortunately Nomad does not offer entrees for food but they do have some snacks. I hope to see everyone there for what seems like it may be an excellent new brewery!
My dog is very friendly, and he and I live alone in a large house with a fenced in yard. Does anyone have a recommendation of a rescue that I can work with to take in foster dogs (or cats, I guess)? The rescue that I adopted my dog from hasn't responded to my inquiries.

There is a quote that I really want to hang in my house, I originally wanted to get it printed on a canvas but couldn't find an image that I like that would print clearly. I found a couple of places to sell it but I don't like the background images they had. Was wondering how expensive it might be to have someone free hand it on a canvas of some sort or to help me format an image to print? Any feedback would be appreciated.

"http://charlotte.aiga.org/event/beer-branding-kickoff-2017/In collaboration with NoDa Brewing Company and BOLTGROUP, AIGA Charlotte presents the Fourth Annual Beer & Branding for summer 2017. At this unique two-part event, local designers work with local home brewers to ideate, brew, and design a branding package based on a secret brewing ingredient. This all starts with our event Kickoff (Thursday, July 13th), and culminates in a brewing competition and a design showcase where attendees will select their favorite branding packages.**Since the Kickoff serves as the first official meeting for designers and brewers, attendance is mandatory for participation.** From there, the objective is to inspire the local beer and design community with a united naming, branding package, and beer product, all while keeping in mind the following aspects: the beer style, the top secret ingredient, the local culture, and the community.Both the Kickoff and Showcase will be held at the NoDa North End location on 2921 N. Tryon Street. Also, both designers and brewers must register through the AIGA Charlotte website to ensure that one designer (or team) is paired with one brewer. **Registration will be cut off one week before the Kickoff, on July 6th.** Once registration is full, weâ€™ll start a waiting list in the event that any designers or brewers drop out. At the Kickoff, no walk-in entrants will be accepted.**If youâ€™re a designer:** First register for the Kickoff event. You can participate individually, as duos to form one team, or as an agency. If youâ€™re a duo or an agency, at least one member of your team must be present at the Kickoff event. At the Showcase, attendees will vote for their favorite branding packages, with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place â€œCrowd Favoritesâ€ù being announced. All final branding packages will be featured on the AIGA Charlotte website.**If youâ€™re a brewer:** First register for the Kickoff event, and then mark your calendar since attendance is mandatory for participation. Beers will be judged by a select panel of beer experts before the Showcase. At the Showcase, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place beers will be announced, and the 1st place beer will also be released as part of the brewery's popular NoDable Series."

"Hello everyone,New face in Charlotte (I live in Belmont) who has been here for about 6 months now and am a single dad who is looking for help for his 5 yr old son. My son is socially delayed and has trouble ""engaging"" with other kids. I take him to the park/playground to play with other kids every week,  sometimes twice when I can, and the poor guy just has so much difficulty communicating and socializing without being ""awkward"". It's been this way for a while. He was problematic and disruptive in preschool too and the teacher suggested I look into some sort of behavioral therapy for him. All that being said, he's a good kid with a great heart and I do my best to affirm that. He will be starting kindergarten this year and my fear is he will be eaten alive by the other kids and become discouraged. When I was living in Virginia, I've had him tested and he is not autistic. I'd like to find some ""social skills"" therapy program in the Charlotte area, but am not sure where to even begin to look. I will be meeting with the guidance counselor in our school system to ask about options, but I wanted to start here first. Any help and recommendations are greatly appreciated! I know with the right direction, he'll turn out fine! Thanks!"

Happy Father's Day everyone! It's almost time for another brewery meetup! This week, we're heading back over to [Legion Brewing](http://legionbrewing.com/), Plaza Midwood's favorite brewery. Probably most recognized for their Juicy Jay IPA, Legion has demonstrated a major talent for every style they put their minds towards. Currently [on tap](http://legionbrewing.com/pages/on-tap-at-legion/) there is a great selection of typical summer styles with IPAs, wheats, and weissbiers. For those of you who prefer their beer a bit darker, they have a robust porter on tap and I have been thoroughly impressed with every dark beer I've had at Legion. For food, Legion has [a kitchen](http://legionbrewing.com/roots/) with some pretty good food (definitely try the boiled peanuts if you like those)! Also don't forget that Tuesdays are trivia nights at Legion so bring your thinking caps! Can't wait to see you all there!

Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

Didn't think anything of it, it was hot and cars overheat, plus I didn't see anyone in it when I drove by. On my way back to the office there where probably 6 CMPD vehicles and the car area was wrapped in crime scene tape. When I left at 4:30, it was all still there and many officers searching the woods and road in surrounding areas. Any idea if it's all related, did we hear a drive by gun fight from the comfort of our cubicles??"

I have 3 friends coming down from the Raleigh area the 23rd and 24th, who want to "do" Charlotte. When you have guests visit who want to experience Charlotte, where do you go?

We just moved to Charlotte about a month ago from FL. We both have lived in FL our whole lives and moved to Charlotte because my bf got a job relocation offer. I am 25/F and my bf is 27.

Recently we both tried paddle boarding and really enjoyed it. We would like to make new friends and hang out with like minded couples. So what recommendations can you give me in order to help us make friends? Also, I am looking for work in the legal field. I have experience with immigration law but am open to other areas of law.

I went to Blue Blaze a few weeks back and they said that they don't fill growlers from outside the brewery. Hmm, ok.  I went to Wooden Robot today and they told me the same thing. Is this a thing at breweries now? I was told it was for sanitation purposes and controlling the quality of the beer that was getting out.  You can buy a Wooden Robot growler, and they swap it out for a new one when you come in for a fill, but they won't touch a growler from a different brewery (also you can't buy WR growlers anymore).  I ended up getting two Crowlers since I had already made the trip, but it's kinda defeating the purpose of the growler, no?  I have three growlers that I can't take to the breweries now.

Hey there everyone! It's time for this week's meetup! We're heading over to [NoDa Brewing](http://nodabrewing.com/home/) this week, to try out one of Charlotte's oldest and most well known breweries. Known primarily for their pale ales (both IPA and regular Pale Ale), NoDa still provides an excellent assortment of styles on their [taplist](http://nodabrewing.com/the-beer/), and have recently been really upping their game on their stouts, producing some excellent, full bodied dark beers. In addition every Tuesday includes the release of a specialty addition to their [NoDable series](http://nodabrewing.com/nodable-series/), where they experiment with new beer styles and flavors, and are typically extremely good! For those of you who, like me, get hungry as you drink, NoDa will be playing host to everyone's favorite Taco Tuesday food truck, [The Tin Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/TheTINKitchen/). I hope to see you all out there!

"I would like to do it myself but I'm nervous about fucking up since I'm about to go on a trip, and would *prefer* to avoid going to compact car off independence because the repair is expensive, while pads themselves are cheap.Help and service would not go unrewarded! I'm happy to pay, just would rather not pay $250.Also, as a side note, is there anywhere to get comparative performance of different pads? Most of what I've seen on AutoZone etc. is pretty uninformative for the layman. I got 50k miles out of factory pads, and ideally these replacements would get the same, if not more.Edit: Have gotten so much help and response! Thank you r/Charlotte I love you guys! Out of town this weekend but I'll follow up with everyone I've been talking to soon."

"Hi Charlotte friends! I am in the process of starting a non-profit that I believe will play a unique part in helping out the Charlotte community.

"A few hours ago, a federal court ordered that new NC legislative maps must be enacted by the General Assembly by Sept. 1st. We finished our regular session for the year earlier this month, so that means we will have to go back into a special session to get it done. There will be no special election - despite the court's previous order to have one - for lack of time. This is frustrating because it means the GOP has been rewarded for dragging its feet, but new maps were - by far - the top priority, and we got that. After the new maps are drawn (by the GOP), the court will then review the maps to ensure compliance with its ruling on racial gerrymandering. The fact that the court has already said it is going to review the maps before they can take effect is crucial. The court has said that if the GOP-drawn map doesn't meet its standards, it will appoint a ""special master"" to draw the map - which would be the worst case scenario for the GOP, in light of how heavily they rely on partisan gerrymandering to maintain control (just as my party did, incidentally). That should scare them into at least attempting a good faith effort, but hey who knows.At a minimum, these new maps it should significantly increase the number of competitive districts across the state. That's good.Ultimately, of course, we absolutely need independent redistricting. Politicians cannot be trusted to draw their own districts. In the meantime, this is progress.Happy to answer any questions.Here's the full court ruling, if you're into that kind of thing: https://www.dropbox.com/s/euby0jyr08o72r2/Order%20on%20Redistricting.pdf?dl=0"
"My SO and I are planning on moving to Charlotte in the next year or so and we were hoping on some info about the neighborhoods.

Her and I are avid golfers and were hoping to apply to Pine Island CC. A CC where we have lived our whole life(southern CA) is out of the question with housing costs(we pay $2k/month rent for a 800sqft 1 bedroom apartment). With the decrease in housing costs the ~$300/month luxury seems doable. So far the houses I've viewed online have been in the northwest area of the city.

Hey there everyone! It's time for another brewery meetup! This week we're heading back to perennial favorite [Flight Beer Hall](http://flightclt.com/). With [91 different taps](http://flightclt.com/beers-on-tap/), Flight offers the best chance in Charlotte to try beers from around the state and country. With only 14 of those beers from somewhere other than NC or SC, there is sure to be something from a brewery you haven't tried on tap! To add to the selection, Tuesdays are 22oz for 16oz nights, so more beer for your buck! Flight supplements their expansive beer list with a great [menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) from which, I still have yet to try anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy! Hope to see you all out there!

Hi, I was wondering if we could have an honest talk about Charlotte crime. What are your thoughts? What are your concerns? Worries? Not worried at all? Is crime slowly encroaching into your enclave? Is this year's murder rate an anamoly? Can we safely discuss the demographics of Charlotte's crime? I'm kinda afraid to post anything for fear of being banned, so I thought I'd start out by just asking some questions.

Going to Charlotte tonight for the 311 concert at the Uptown Amphitheater and am wanting to chow down on some excellent BBQ.  The selections that pop up the most I see are Queen City Q, Sauce Man's, City Smoke, Mac's Speed Shop, and Midwood Smokehouse.  Any preferences you would recommend from one over another, all seem to have great reviews so far.  One thing im not really into with NC BBQ is lexington style sauces, most are too watery and too much vinegar, I like the thicker Hickory style sauces.  But am very open to something different.  Thanks for the advice in advance!  

I know it's last minute but I had something come up and can't use my tickets for tonight's 311 show. I have two lawn seats for the music factory and paid a total of $80 and some change for them. Let me know if you can use them!

"Hey guys, I wanted to share this because I sometimes see questions coming from overweight/obese people who are concerned about the rides at Carowinds. (I'm not posting this under my usual handle, as I don't want my weight listed on it.) I'm going to share my and my husband's personal weight details and maybe that'll help some folks with their decision on going or avoiding certain Walk of Shame potential rides. (For the record, we're both changing our lifestyles and have lost quite a bit of weight this year before anyone says anything.)Me: female, 5'6, 250, I carry most of my weight in my thighs and torso.Husband: male, 5'8 240, his weight is more evenly distributed, no big gut, large thighs. He had no real problems with any rides. A few were snug, but everything clicked/buckled.Intimidator: I barely got the two clicks. The seat belt was plenty long enough and I was squished like hell in the seat. My husband had to push down the lap bar (or whatever it's called) to get my two clicks. A woman who appeared to be about 15 pounds heavier than me had to leave the ride, so I was cutting it super close.This was the toughest for me. I was going to skip it because I didn't get two clicks on the test seat, BUT I walked through the line with my husband and kid anyway and thought I'd try a back row seat. It did fit a bit better and I got the clicks. Afterburn: It was also a bit snug (but not as much as the Intimidator). I sat on Row 6, which had seats that have double belts and are supposed to have slightly larger seats. No problem with the harness or buckles. Cobra - I saw in the last row on this, too. I was comfortable and had no issues. Nighthawk - I skipped this because I don't like it, but husband rode with no problem. Cyclone - Also no issues. Rapids - No issues. Woodstock Express - I rode in a seat by myself. Had no issues with this other than leg space, but since I was by myself, that was fine. Boo Blasters - All fine. Do-Si-Do - All fine.Pants vs. Zombies - Not very comfortable since my butt was on the back ridge of the seat, but no real issues. Rock 'N Roller - Fine.Scrambler - Fine.Aerial chase - My husband rode this with my son. Said it was snug but the harness went down. Peanuts Pirates - No problem. I didn't get to try several things, unfortunately, because the rain closed everything (and we only had twilight tickets, so were there for about 4.5 hours). But I hope this info will help anyone who searches for this or has any concerns about fitting. Edit: All of the operators were very nice and helpful when I asked about any ""Big Boy"" seat. No smirks or snide comments, which I know isn't everyone's experience, but I was happy that people were nice."

"Hi r/charlotte,I am graduating from a post-bacc program next week and my family wants to go out to dinner after the ceremony to celebrate.

Hey there everyone! It's time for this week's meetup, and we're heading back to [Olde Mecklenburg Brewing](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/), the brewery that really started the boom we've seen in Charlotte. As *the* German-style brewery in Charlotte, OMB focuses on brewing in compliance with the reinheitsgebot, the German purity laws. This leads to each of the [beers on tap](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/beer/) being an excellent and very clean example of their style. OMB also offers a great [menu](http://www.oldemeckbrew.com/brauhaus#menu) of German and bar style food to go with your beers. Weather permitting, I'm hoping to sit outside so those of you with dogs, feel free to bring them with you! As always, remember that Tuesdays at OMB are also yoga night so you may end up in one of the overflow parking areas, but there should be plenty of space to park. Hope to see you all there!

In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

Hey there everyone! We're heading back out to Cornelius this weekend for [Primal Brewing](http://www.primalbrewery.com/), a definite favorite of mine around Charlotte. Open since December of 2014, Primal has made a definite name for itself in the Lake Norman and North Charlotte areas. Home to a [wide variety of beers](http://www.primalbrewery.com/beer/index.php), there is absolutely something for everyone at Primal, from their year-round selection I definitely suggest either their Kick Ass Kolsch or their Mother of Human Kindness Hazelnut Stout. For food, there should be a food truck at the brewery, though it is not listed on their website. And for entertainment, there will be live music starting in the taphouse at 8 if we are still going strong (which I hope to be!) I hope to see you all there as there will not be a Saturday meetup next week!

But, I highly suspect that isn't the case. Thoughts?

"Hey r/Charlotte, I am moving here next month and I'd like to start looking for a band as soon as possible so I was wondering if anyone had any additional suggestions beyond craigslist and going to shows as I've already posted and I will definitely be going to shows, I play guitar and more in the indie/post-rock spectrum of things, if you're interested I will put more info on the bottom you can check out.Also I didn't see any recent(less than a year) posts on craft beer, etc so I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions/starting places, I am currently in the Tampa Bay area so I am familiar with almost everything in the area and I know most of the big names in Asheville, with Green Man and Pisgah being my favorites, I am open to all styles but I tend to drink IPAs, Hoppier Pale ales and Porters.If anyone has any other advice on moving to charlotte in general I welcome it, I've been on the subreddit for a few months and have checked out some of the older posts(4+ years).P.S. does anyone have any suggestions for the best hookah bar?More info on what I'm looking for musically:I would like to play guitar, I also play piano, bass and some percussion and have been playing over 20 years on and off.

Hi friends, I'm new to the Charlotte area and trying to filter through all the rental options.  The apartments here are awesome, but I really don't want to pay for amenities that I won't have time to use (pool, gym, etc), and I'd prefer not to have roommates since my schedule is pretty erratic and I don't know anyone here.  Are there any cheap one bed/studio apartments that are safe for a mid-20s female that gets home from work late at night?  Location isn't a huge issue because I'll be commuting regardless...for the time being I just need somewhere that has a roof and running water that's safe and will give me some chance of saving money.  Are there any places like this or am I looking for something that doesn't even exist here?

"I moved to Charlotte a few months ago and live in a pretty tightly packed neighborhood with lots of homes close together on small lots (lots of renters as well, my family included). Pretty much since we've moved in we've seen and heard the same dirt bike and atv riding around the neighborhood with teenagers or younger on it, usually during the day and every now again at midnight or later on all days of the week. Their riding includes riding wheelies down the road, burning out on the back tire of the bike, and otherwise generally making a ton of noise. During one of 12:30am Tuesday night occurrences I reached out to the non-emergency police line, and after asking us some questions about if the riders were disrupting traffic or committing any other crimes they stated ""we'll see if we can get an officer available to come through the neighborhood."" I've called twice since then (once daytime once night) and gotten a similarly disinterested response. Other neighbors have also mentioned calling without any change to the rider's habits. Is there any way to address this other than continuing to call? During the day the engine noise is obnoxious, but when it jolts you out of sleep in the middle of the night it's infuriating. Some neighbors and friends I've discussed this with have joked about backing out in front of them or leaving nails on the road but I'm not interested in potentially seriously injuring them (they're just kids being punks).

"During the summer of 2014, my (currently 18-year-old) son researched and ordered components online to put together a desktop for gaming and homework. A couple of weeks ago, the video and subsequently the power went out.Subsequently, he has replaced the motherboard, RAM, power supply, and display card. Nothing has worked so far.  All the fans in the motherboard, power supply, and display card spin up. Unfortunately, there is no display from either the onboard display or the display card output. He is absolutely distraught.Are there any recommendations for reasonably cheap and competent independent repair facilities where he can take it in for diagnosis/repair?  He doesn't have a lot of money left, but he has reached the end of his own expertise.We live in Ballantyne."

"Hey there! I am new to the US and like the rest of the world, where I am from, you usually don't tip as much for food. I have adapted well to 15-18% for food in regular restaurants for average service and 20% for good service but two scenarios always have me perplexed. Tipping at:1. Food trucks2. Take out placesI know tipping is optional and I have Googled this to find the canned answers but I would like to know from some local people possible people who work at such a place to tell me what is the norm here. I don't want to be the asshole who undertips compared to local people while I am not made of money. Thank you very much !"

Fuck this has happened way to many times and the city won't do anything to fix it. Context first. Our house is right after a blind curve which before hand is probably 1.2 miles of roughly straight road. Pretty often people like to speed down that street unbeknownst to them of the curve at the end. Usually people end up hitting our fence or worse the telephone pole that's on the side of the street. Well it happened again tonight and unfortunately our fence took the punishment. Also the fuck thought it was a good idea to hit one of our cars while they were backing out. At least this time when it happened we had security cameras installed so it picked up some of it but I doubt it will help. We've complained multiple times to the city about this curve and how they need signage about it, but yet there is nothing until you get close up to it. Hopefully someone doesn't have to die for them to actually do something about it.
I live south of South Charlotte (Marvin), so growing up, I sadly never really interacted with many people outside of Union County. Now that I'm in college in the city, I see that people seem to really dislike the Marvin/Waxhaw area, but that many more *hate* Myers Park *with a fiery passion*. I've always thought MP was so pretty since I love old architecture and tree-lined streets, but is it really that disliked? Is it all in my head? Serious question - not a troll of any kind. 
"Hello!I am hoping to find someone who would be interested in building/ designing a ""Front Support"" wheelchair for my senior dog! Back in April I adopted my 10 year old pup and shortly after having him, the lil fella decided to parkour off my couch and as a result - broke both his front legs. I took him up to the great doctors at NC State Veterinary School to have his legs operated on. Long story short - he is not able to use his front legs as much and will need assistance. The web has a lot of options for back leg support and full body support but very few options for front leg support.[Chachy ""Lil' Nugget"" ](https://www.gofundme.com/42idgco)I am hoping that my fellow Reddit community can help me out and create something great for my dog! Thank you!

"Hey there everyone! Well, we've finally done it! As of this coming Tuesday, we will have hit each of Charlotte's own breweries!!! As such, this Saturday we're going to be starting the next phase of the meetup, the greater Charlotte Area! We're going to start out at [Ass Clown Brewing](http://www.assclownbrewing.com/contact-2/), a couple miles north of the city in Cornelius. Home to over 200 unique beers, [including 14 that they brew throughout the year](http://www.assclownbrewing.com/year-round-beers//), Ass Clown is a great place to try a variety of styles. Their website indicates that they sometimes have food trucks on Saturdays, but if not there are several pizza places in the area that deliver easily.To give everyone an update on how things are going to be progressing moving forward with the meetup, I'm going to be having the out of Charlotte breweries restricted to Saturday's from now on, and probably start those meetups a bit earlier (probably around 4) than in the past. This should give those who want to come to these out of Charlotte meetups a reprieve from traffic that would be a problem during the week. I'm also going to start trying to work with the breweries that are closed on Tuesdays in Charlotte to see if they will open for us, since we bring in so much business. The first of these are going to start with Thirsty Nomad in a month or two, as a proof of concept. If things continue to go well as we expand the meetup like this, I'm going to start looking into full day trips once every few months, but that is a long way down the line.Thanks to everyone who has taken this meetup from just myself at a brewery at one point a little over a year and a half ago, to what it is today with nearly 30 people every week, and here's to the future! I hope to see you all at Ass Clown!!"
"As many of you know, I was grappling with a decision regarding taking a new position. I decided to go for it! Thanks to all who provided some valuable input! I'm nervous but exited for a new chapter in my career.&nbsp;Now onto business. First, let me stress that **I do not have any real bearing on management decisions here for hiring potential candidates.** This post is not any sort of guaranteed employment for whoever responds to it. I just want to help vet potential candidates as best I can, and point people in this company's direction.I'm leaving at what is pretty much the worst possible time. People have vacations coming up, and the busier months are upon us. This position has afforded me a great chance to get my feet wet in the industry, especially being someone with no on paper experience prior to taking this position. The owner of this location has also treated me really well. For those reasons, I want to do what I can to make a transition to someone new as speedy and smooth as possible.This position would be a great opportunity for a technically minded individual who may want to take a first step into IT. Even if IT isn't a career aspiration, someone with experience building and troubleshooting PC's would be a good fit as well.&nbsp;I don't want to list the actual location out of desire for privacy but feel free to PM for specifics and more info.Day to day duties/requirements are as follows:- Check in customers using front desk ticketing system- Provide hardware and software support to a variety of desktop and laptop computers and other devices both in person and over the phone (Phone support is not really a provided service here, but the ability to convey knowledge over the phone is *extremely* beneficial. That being said, being comfortable on the phone is a plus )- Maintain detailed documentation of processes and procedures used to diagnose checked in devices - Emphasize the use of preventative maintenance and data backup services - Research and provide quotes and any ordering information for system hardware/software repairs and/or upgrades - Effectively communicate diagnoses and available solutions to customers in a concise and easy to understand manner - Provide excellent customer service while resolving issues quickly and to the clientâ€™s satisfaction- Knowledge of disk imaging software, command line, and DOS based programs is a plus, though not really required.- Assist sales team by providing information on products to customers as needed (this is not absolutely required, but a bonus for sure)The environment here is super relaxed and great for someone who isn't turned on by corporate workplaces and too much oversight. If you're someone who is interested in learning and growing in technology, and are able to maintain a steady work flow, this would be a great place to start! If you have *any* questions or would like more specifics, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message. Thanks for reading everyone! Have a great night.P.S. Shout out to the mods for letting me post this. You guys rule, and so does r/Charlotte!!!"

By definition it is small, but important.  This is not NYC or Chicago, but there are things to do, if you put yourself out there and try to escape your comfort zone.There are theaters, museums, restaurants, hiking, and everything that other small cities offer.  Sure, there's no Guggenheim, Broadway, Michelin starred restaurants, but there are people who utilize what they have at their disposal to try and live a happy life.  If you find something missing from Charlotte, step up and create it.   This is America, don't whine, DO.I take great offense to those who disrespect the city that has welcomed me and helped me evolve into a better person.  I doubt those people can find happiness in any other city, let alone within themselves."

It's a great opportunity.

Hello all! So I've just moved to Charlotte and I'm still getting used to the incredible CATS system (I mean this literally: no complaints from me). Starting next week I'll be going to training for my job M-F, so I was thinking that the cheapest thing would be to get a 10-ride pass. My question would be do transfers count against the 10 rides, or is it just a trip one way that counts (for example, my commute would be riding the 30 inbound then transferring to the 2 outbound. Would this count as one ride or two?) Thanks so much!

The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"

Hey there everyone! Sorry for the late notice, I *definitely* thought today was still Wednesday, having a Tuesday off will do that to ya! So it's time for one of the last Charlotte breweries we haven't made it to, [Free Range Brewing](http://www.freerangebrewing.com/)! While not one of the most well known breweries in Charlotte yet, Free Range has been working to make a name for themselves as one of the best experimenters in the Charlotte area. Currently, their [tap list](http://www.freerangebrewing.com/#on-tap) offers a nice blend of light summer beers with IPAs and farmhouse ales, and dark, full bodied brews, with some excellent looking stouts. It's difficult to track their food but it seems like recently for Saturday's they've been playing host to [Bleu Barn Bistro Food Truck](http://bleubarnbistro.com/), a farm-to-table style food truck that certainly has my interest piqued! I hope to see you all there!!

"Hey all. Just moved to Charlotte 5 days ago, and while the city is incredible, and we LOVE it, the Apartment (really close to UNCC) we moved into kind of turns into ""The hood"" at night, which offers some safety implications... I don't think I really need to say anymore. In short, we can't see ourselves living here long-term. We're looking for an area where the young professionals hang out, as we both have our Master's degree (we're both 25), and would like to meet some like-minded people. We kind of feel trapped because we can't really use any of the facilities at night because of the aforementioned reasons... for instance, just two days ago there was broken glass in the pool, and people left all of their garbage scattered all over the place... the grills are constantly filthy.. etc. (speaks a great deal of the people we're co-existing with).The IDEAL place would be a reasonable (20-30 minute) commute to UNC, where my girlfriend will be working. I'm also applying for jobs in the area. It APPEARS that Uptown would be the place for it to live for that (please correct me if I'm wrong), but we're open to any suggestions. Now, another thing which is presenting us some problems... the apartments in Uptown all seem to have a 1-car rule. Does anybody know of any that can do 2 cars? We both need to get to work and 1 car isn't going to work out..Seriously ANY advice would be appreciated as we're both very new to the area. "

It seems like the rental market around the area is on fire!  It seems like as soon as I like,  it is unavailable!  Drove around for literally 6 hours today looking at houses, either they're in a crappy neighborhood, or by the time I get there to see it, it's already been rented!!  What's the secret?? Has anyone used an agent to help find a rental house?  Is that even a thing?  I'm new to this area so I'm unfamiliar with all neighborhoods and whatnot.. driving around for hours at a time seems so inefficient.

"I don't know if you all get your districts letters but I sign up for them in an effort to keep a pulse on how they talk to each other and about their policies, right and wrong. Not sure how I started getting Bishops posts (probably transfered from Rucho's.) The first one I got was saying I could meet him if I ponied up a thousand for a dinner during the holiday season. Love me some fundraisers /s.Anyhow, I thought I'd just paste this here in an effort to keep communication open. I know Jackson hits up our NC efforts and is appreciated for doing so--might be good to keep an eye on the other side of the aisle where the centripetal spin feels higher. If anyone wants to break reality into this I'm always up for a good read.> Legislative Update Summary of 2017 Long Session July 2017 From the desk of Sen. Bishop:> The 2017 Regular Session of the North Carolina General Assembly adjourned in the wee hours Friday, June 30, following the inevitable, two-week frenzy of late nights and sometimes heated negotiations.  The two top stories from this session â€” the fourth consecutive long session under Republican control â€” both arise from our $23 billion biennial budget, enacted notwithstanding the governorâ€™s veto.>First, continued spending discipline is ushering state government into an era of unprecedented fiscal soundness, especially relative to other states.  For the first time ever, the state savings reserve or â€œrainy day fundâ€ù balance will meet the statutory target of 8% of the general fund budget ($1.82 billion).  Future budgets will progress toward a new target of 12%. >We have begun to confront the practice of mortgaging our childrenâ€™s future through massively unfunded state employee retirement benefits.  North Carolinaâ€™s unfunded retiree health and pension obligations, accrued over many years, exceed $6,000 per capita.  The good news is that we are better off than many other states, such as Illinois (almost $21,000 per capita) and Connecticut (almost $14,000 per capita).  The better news is that we are addressing the issue from a position of budget strength and strong credit rather than the constraints of deficits and heavy debt.  This yearâ€™s $.5 billion annual revenue surplus was the third in a row since the 2013 fundamental tax reform.>Under our budget, following the lead of the private sector, the State will end the practice of promising free, but unfunded, retiree health benefits-for-life to new hires by 2021.  One result will be to enable the State in due course to improve current employee compensation.  In fact, we have begun to do so for public school teachers, and this budget continues that progress.  It provides for the fourth and fifth consecutive annual pay raises for teachers (beyond step increases), averaging 10% over the biennium.>Second, continuing the balancing act that has distinguished North Carolina from every other state in the country, we have budgeted another installment of tax relief for North Carolinians even as we further solidify the fiscal structure of our state.  Reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates will reinforce the business environment that corporate recruiters have ranked #1 in the nation and that has yielded better-than-average personal income growth and an influx of talent fleeing basket-case states like IL and CT.  A further increase in the standard deduction (the â€œzero bracketâ€ù) â€” to $20,000 â€” will take thousands more off the tax rolls, boosting citizens of modest incomes.>One notable person termed this budget irresponsible â€” in fact, â€œthe most irresponsible ever.â€ù  To me, that rhetoric serves as a reminder that even as it becomes more tempting to take for granted the Republican General Assemblyâ€™s string of budget successes, an opposition waits in the wings to return North Carolina to the budget deficits and the pay-to-play, special interest dominance of yesteryear.  That would mean another generation of wasted opportunity.  Prosperity is a discipline, not a fate.  And in this historically poor, southeastern State, the breeze of prosperity is beginning to blow.  Letâ€™s do all we can to keep it going.>It has been the privilege of my life to support this new direction for our State.>â€”   Senator Dan Bishop"

Hi all! I need a recommendation for finding folks to do odd jobs around the house - one that's vetted (or has reviews) and is inexpensive.

"Commenting on the Charlotte 2017 fireworks display downtown from BB&T Stadium, I am charecterizing the event as ""The Charlotte Fireworks Fizzle"".Here is my review:We first attempted to watch the fireworks in Charlotte from Eucild Street just off Morehead, as were several other groups of people - A perfect view of the downtown Charlotte skyline.When the fireworks started, we discovered that Pyro Shows had limited the height of the fireworks display so low, that no one could see them from the south side except a small slice partial view between skyscrapers. I have never seen fireworks in any major city like this (living in DC and NYC).We tried relocating to just two blocks west of BB&T Stadium (looking down Mint St from Morehead) with at least 1000 others lined up along the same stretch, but the best one could see was the very tops of the hightest reaching displays. Some were standing on cars in the attempt to see more to no avail.I have been to privately funded fireworks that could be seen for miles. This was a huge disappointment, and organizers should have announced that the only viewing areas would be within one block of the display.Growing up in Charlotte, but now living in DC (and prior, living 3 years in NYC), I wasn't expecting the same level of fireworks show as those major cities with their noted history of amazing Independence Day fireworks shows, but this was ridiculous, a huge disappointment, and well below standard for a city of Charlotte's size and beauty.The gorgeous Charlotte skyline could have been lit up this July 4th... Instead, it was a small time pyrotechnics show intended for viewing by only those attending the game, or in the adjacent park.A great opportunity for Charlotte that was completely wasted, and a ""black eye"" for Charlotte civic leaders.(link to photo taken from Mint and Morehead - https://imgur.com/gallery/bOjzH)"

My wife and I just had our first child. Right now we're in on Tampa Bay and the school area is horrible. We were thinking it might be a nice change and we thought about Charlotte, Asheville, or Raleigh. We're just beginning our research now, but does anyone have advice about the school system?

The shop is not far from the store, but it is at the bottom of a driveway that goes downhill, and it's on a pretty busy road (Woodlawn).  Sadly, they do not deliver, but they have the best price I can find.I'm thinking a lift gate would be the best option - but I haven't been able to find a rental truck with a lift gate that isn't something like a huge box truck, which I really don't want to be backing down a driveway right on Woodlawn.Do any of you know an alternate solution?Also, have any of you bought your own cabinet table saws?

"So my wife and I (recent transplants) learned the hard way this weekend that it's illegal to swim in Lake Norman unless:* You're on a boat* You own property on the lake* You live somewhere that has leased private beach accessGiven the size of this lake I found that to be absurd, but apparently that's how things are. Ramsey Beach and Lake Norman State Park are a joke, as we also discovered. So, anyone know of an old fashioned access area or dock sort of *off the grid* where those state park rent-a-cops don't patrol?In fairness, the one I encountered was very cool and apologetic, which is impressive because I'm sure they have to do this every weekend, so my issue is with the lack of public access more than anything else."
"Session formally ended for the year last week, but we've already got two special sessions planned: one in August, to consider any vetoes, and one in September, to address redistricting.There were a lot of headlines flying around in the last few weeks, so here's a quick list of bills that *did not* pass both chambers.- A plan to redraw the maps for Superior and District Court districts, as well as prosecutorial districts. This will likely be taken up in September.- Impeachment of our State Secretary, Elaine Marshall. It feels like leadership in both chambers recognized this as a political stunt that would backfire badly, and have since backed off.- Pursuant to a federal court overturning our voter ID law, there was speculation it would make a comeback in a different form. For now, it hasn't.- A bill to allow anyone 18 and older to carry a concealed weapon without first obtaining a permit from a county sheriff's office.- A number of bills making major changes to immigration laws and penalties.- A bill that would put a $1.9 billion bond for school construction on the November 2018 ballot.- A bill to legalize and regulate fantasy sports.- A bill to close our state's rape loophole with respect to the revocation of consent.- A bill that would allow school districts in 20 counties to experiment with setting their own start and end dates to the school year.- A bill to fine drivers who block traffic in the left lane of a highway.- A bill requesting a national convention to make changes to the U.S. Constitution (i.e., ""convention of the states"" - the last one was in 1787)."

Fiance and I are considering moving uptown for a year then buy a house and get a little more serious about life.  Looking from Uptown - South End area (think they're calling this LoSo now?) to around the stadium.  Any personal experience people have had with complexes around this area would be great.  I'm not expecting luxury just a good time enjoying ourselves uptown and a management company that aren't completely incompetent and / or jerks.

It's beautiful out today and I'm thinking about going out to get a drink somewhere outside to enjoy it.  Any takers?  I am not dead set on any particular place to go.  I'm a 33 year old dude who likes to think he enjoys the outdoors, and not really good at meeting people but eventually open up, so hopefully you are OK with some initial silence.
"I was able to find Tuna steaks at Fresh Market, but, I was wondering if anyone knew where to get other types of fish that are Sashimi grade for making Sushi at home..."
do local places like wooden robot, omg, noda only fill growlers if it is their own branded growler or do they fill other ones, say a vacuum insulate one?
"I mean what happened?  Last year they did the box install outside my house and 12 months later nothing.  I know they are going through problems but seems like we are on the slow walk to nowhere and no I will not goto att !!So any inside knowledge ?"
"Here it is Charlotte! It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.  The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!"
"Setting off all these fireworks to celebrate Canada day so close to our dear July 4th.Unpatriotic!All jokes aside, be safe guys! "

What are some fun things, preferrably cheap, to do around Charlotte that would be cute dates? Hiking locations, swimming holes, outdoorsey activities would be appreciated! Bonus: Good mid priced resturants that have a nice or unique atmosphere? 
I know there's no brewery meet-up tonight, but is anyone up to anything fun this evening? 
I know nothing about the laws surrounding alcohol or any good spots to drink besides BirdSong in NoDa. Please enlighten me
"Last week I found 3 baby kittens at my apartment complex living in a bush, and took them to a ""no kill"" shelter near Ballantye. I kept my number as the emergency contact just in case and they just called me to tell me that they are scheduled to be euthanized. Idk why a ""no kill"" shelter plans to euthanized kittens but I'm not going to let that happen. They are sweet cats, about 3 months old. They've had all the shots they can at this age and are healthy. You can take 1 or all 3, 100% free to a good home. You can PM your number to me and we can meet whenever if you or someone you know wants one. Thanks!UPDATE: two left!UPDATE 2: Photos! [Kitten 1](http://imgur.com/gv2V3ze) and [Kitten 2](http://imgur.com/STMtYzI)UPDATE 3: the last two have found a great home together with a fellow redditor. Thanks for the help everyone!"
"Thank you in advance for the replies.  I am looking for a good body shop in which I have to pay out of pocket for the damages :( Any honest body shop that does work at a good price would be appreciated!"
I'm looking for someone who restores old wooden furniture.  Is there anyone in the Charlotte area that you know of or could recommend? 
My wife and I are in to making yogurt, and we have been using cheese cloth, but we would like to use a nut bag. Short of buying it online, anywhere in CLT that carries them in stock?
