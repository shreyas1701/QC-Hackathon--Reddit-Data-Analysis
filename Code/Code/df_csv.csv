42o5mk,Tuesday night Dungeons and Dragons near the university/plaza.,1,"**When:** Most Tuesday nights, from 5:30 until 9:30. Next session is tomorrow, the 26th.**Where:** [Get Some Game](http://www.getsomegame.com/), A local game store. If you have trouble finding it, I'll try to provide extra directions. I may also be able to provide transportation depending on your own location.**What you need:** Honestly, just a character sheet and a pencil, and even those I can provide if needed. Optional goodies are the player's handbook for convenience, and your own set of dice (though I have a few that can be used. All you really need is a good attitude and a love for roleplaying games.**Character Creation:** You're allowed to use any class or race option made available by Wizards of the Coast, including their Unearthed Arcana resources. This is fifth edition. If you're new, then I and the other players can help you out with character creation when you show up. If you'd like to make the character ahead of time, we're using standard array/27 point buy. DO NOT roll the character's stats.**Current Party:** I won't go into detail about their stories as that's up to the players themselves how much they divulge and when. The current make up is a Human Ranger who dual wields swords, a Halfling Arcane Trickster Rogue, and a Drow/Dark Elf Monk Assassin. There is also a Half-Elf Bard, though she is unfortunately an infrequent player at the moment and occupies essentially a guest spot. I'd prefer new players not have classes already being used, but as long as there's enough difference between them, it's not a major issue.**Setting:** Details [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3l8kl7/the_world_for_my_dd_campaign_setting_sabah_a_land/) if you're interested in the read. Long story short, the story takes place post-apocalyptic magical war. It's a homebrew setting, so you don't need to know anything about the other D&D worlds. We're making plenty up as we go, so if there's an aspect you're interested in that hasn't been explored yet, you can bring it up so it can be incorporated into the campaign.That's about it. If there's any questions, then please let me know. The group is incredibly easy going and laid back. Every single person in the group so far has been completely new to either D&D or this particular edition, so we're all very newbie friendly. I can run at most about 7 players, and currently only have 3 (possibly 4) regulars. Not being able to show up for a session isn't a big deal and your character will quickly be caught up with the rest of the party.",Ignisiel,2,0,10,1/26/16 6:25,0.147182201,self.Charlotte,5007,Events/Happenings,44

Some people were without power for a week.  While we joke about bread and milk, there are some things you should consider doing should the 1/2"" of ice materialize and power gets knocked out.Fill up your car with gas.  When the power went out in 2002 there were no gas stations that had working pumps unless you drove for awhile (assuming the roads were open and clear).It's going to get dark.  DAMN dark.  Like you've never seen it dark.  You may want to make sure you have flash lights, batteries and/or candles.You may want to contact relatives and establish a contact plan.  When the power goes out regionally, and for awhile, things like cell towers start to go offline.You may want to ready a bug-out kit in case you decide to leave your home for warmer shelter.  The kit should include some cash, medicines, change of clothes, toothbrush/paste and such.Put a tarp or something over your windshield.  I can assure you, scraping off a half inch of ice off your windshield is a BITCH.For the love of all things holy, don't try to warm your place up with a BBQ grill.  Seriously.  You do that, and you won't have to worry about using that grill ever again.Here's info on the 2002 storm - some areas saw up to 3/4"" of an inch of ice which made it particularly ugly.http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nwsfo/storage/cases/20021204/",caller-number-four,28,90,54,1/21/16 23:49,0.036764706,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

412d3n,To the man passed out in his car on Church Street tonight...,1,"Maybe you weren't drunk. Maybe you have a medical condition. Your head was tilted back and to the right. Your mouth was open like you were snoring away. I knew something was amiss when the light turned green and you didn't move. We pulled around you and over to the side of the road. My boyfriend got out of the car and banged on the window of your SUV. A van pulled aside and blared his horn in an effort to wake you up. My boyfriend noticed that your car was still in drive and your foot was on the brake pedal. He decided to call the cops. When the first officer got there she was finally able to rouse you from your sleep. Instead of putting the car in park like she asked you attempted to drive off. You were disoriented. You finally put the car in park and stumbled out. That's when we left, when we knew that you were safe and that everyone else on the road was. You were still in your white dress shirt and tie. Perhaps you went out with coworkers and had a bit too much fun. Maybe you were blowing off steam. But now you're more than likely nursing one hell of a hangover in Mecklenburg County Jail and don't exactly know how you got there. On our way home my boyfriend expressed that he felt slightly guilty about being a 'tattletale'. I don't feel guilty at all though.

40jc99,I77 Toll Lane,1,"What are the main reason people are opposed to toll lanes?Several reasons, provided by u/turkey_slap, in no particular order...* They're not your typical toll/express lanes where that you pay a small price to use. Pricing will be varied based on congestion in the general purpose lanes. The more congested the general lanes are, the more it will cost to use the toll lanes. It could cost $.05 a mile or $1.00 a mile.* The lanes will not be built or managed by NCDOT or the NC Turnpike Authority. A Spanish company named Cintra will build the lanes. In exchange for building them, they will keep all profits for 50 years.* During that 50 year life of the contract, NC will not be allowed to widen, or add more capacity (general purpose lanes), to I-77 without paying a penalty to Cintra.* If toll revenues fail to meet projected profits, the state of NC (i.e., taxpayers) must reimburse Cintra for the lost revenue.* NC taxpayers are contributing around $100 million to the project. If one general purpose lane was added to I-77 between exits 23 and 36 - where congestion is the worst - it the cost likely wouldn't exceed that $100 million amount.* NC pays one of the highest gas taxes in the US. Gas taxes are supposed to go to pay for road construction. NCDOT is funding many other multi-million dollar road construction projects across the state in places that are much less populated. The Charlotte is and has been one of the fastest growing areas in the US for several years. They claim that they don't have the money to improve I-77, but can somehow fund these other projects.* NCDOT refuses to score the I-77 widening project with their new 'objective' scoring formula. Likewise, when they proposed this project, they insisted that the entire stretch from the Lake Norman area down to Charlotte be included (rather than just scoring the area between exits ~19 and 36). This inflated the projected cost of the project.* The toll lanes will not allow tractor trailers in them and will not be constructed with concrete thick enough to handle their weight.* The existing HOV lanes from Charlotte to Exit 23 will turned into toll/HOT lanes. NC taxpayers already paid for these lanes. They are essentially being given to Cintra for profit.* The current passenger requirement for HOV lanes is 2 people in a vehicle. This will be increased to 3 people for the HOT/toll lanes and will only be ""free"" if your vehicle is equipped with a transponder.* There is a lot of collusion and political corruption being uncovered with regard to this whole project. Most of it is centered around Thom Tillis and Gov McCrory.* These lanes are a Public Private Partnership (P3) and seen by many as part of the Republican agenda to privatize public resources. P3's came about, in part, from ALEC (the Koch Brothers) which is essentially an organization which crafts model legislation and passes it off to state legislatures to sign into law.* Cintra has declared bankruptcies on two other toll road projects in the US - Indiana and Texas. Their projections for profit on I-77 would make this toll road the highest grossing toll road in the US, which is completely unrealistic.I think that covers the most salient points. I'm sure I forgot some, but that should give the basics.**EDIT 1/12/16**From the recent vote, per u/lollylewlaylow :* Four council members â€“ Democrats Claire Fallon, Al Austin and LaWana Mayfield and Republican Kenny Smith â€“ voted against directing its CRTPO member, Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, to support the toll lanes.* Voting in favor of toll lanes were Republican Ed Driggs and Democrats John Autry, Patsy Kinsey, Julie Eiselt, Vi Lyles, James Mitchell and Greg Phipps.**EDIT 1/13/16**[This map](http://i.imgur.com/x9i7ooP.png) was made by u/zverkalt showing which representative corresponds to each district, color coded by votes for and against.[This graph](https://i.imgur.com/yqMd1fD.png) made by u/USSDoyle shows Cintra's profit projections for I77 vs. other metropolitan areas with toll roads.

There is a referral program, but I'll keep my name out so you know this is just me talking about an awesome time. We've had a relationship with Hendrick Honda for a long time. About 8 years ago, when we had an odyssey, they did us a huge favor. The transmission in our van completely died. Like. $7k put a new one in. The service manager there knew us, and knew that my mom was in the middle of a medical crisis. We told him we just didn't have the money, and we were ready to just give up the van. He said ""Give me a few hours"" and somewhere down the line, the Hendrick family actually stepped in and said, ""Don't worry about it"" and fixed up our van, pro bono. Now that was 8 YEARS AGO. Alot can change, and its been 5 years since we've owned a Honda. I had a $7k budget to buy a used reliable car to get me to and from college. I doubted I would find something like that at a dealer. I walk in, tell them my exact budget, and they hooked me up. A 2006 civic that was originally priced at $6998, and they docked it down until it was exactly $7000 after tax title and fees.The salespeople are nice, not to mention they have this cool thing in the finance offices where you sign electronically like, on the desk. Its really interesting. They helped me find a car that I truly believe will last me through college, and they seem to all have the same attitude as they did 8 years ago. They really know their stuff about their cars, and really care about getting you exactly what you need.I'm really happy I bought my car from there, because I get to recreate an old relationship my family had with the dealership. I know if there is EVER a problem, Hendrick Honda will do everything they can to help me out.TL;DR: Hendrick Honda is amazing. If you are looking at getting a new or used car, I'd go check them out.",SloanTheSloth,5,11,0,1/7/16 22:36,0.240917799,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

It will take you 15-30 mins. Focus on the 50 year non compete agreements and how you feel about it. Let them know that this is one of the only issues that you vote on.

Tom tailored the talk to Charlotte residents who want to learn about their growing city and do something about it. There were constant questions from the audience, including the unanswered, ""So what do we do about it?""To recap a few of the history lessons:* 1875 - Charlotte was reasonably, surprisingly integrated* 1890 - Depression, increased fear. Voting laws were passed which included poll taxes and/or literacy tests. While this affected all poor and uneducated, it particularly disenfranchised black citizens. Outcomes included the plummeting of funding for black schools and ordinances requiring minimum home costs in some areas.* 1930's onward - Mortgage discrimination. Even federal mortgage guidelines explicitly rank desirability of ethnic groups. Black citizens and black neighborhoods can't get mortgages.* 1960's - Charlotte known for doing relatively well at desegregation at the time.(I don't recall if he outlined historical causes for increases in segregation after the civil rights era)Jan 2016 Charlotte Agenda post introducing the event:https://www.charlotteagenda.com/34967/charlotte-agenda-live-speaker-series-events/Today's Charlotte Agenda post from Tom:https://www.charlotteagenda.com/39217/tom-hanchett-city-of-strangers/---Anyone that went, please chime in with what you thought or other points that I missed.",mclaffey,1,4,8,2/19/16 10:05,-0.058459596,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

45yzm9,Tuesday night Dungeons and Dragons.,1,"**When:** Most Tuesday nights, from 5:30 until 9:30. Next session is tomorrow, the 16th.**Where:** [Parker, Banner, Kent, & Wayne](http://pbkwcomics.com/) over in Cornelius, NC. It's behind a Rite-Aid. If you have trouble finding it, I'll try to provide extra directions. I may also be able to provide transportation depending on your own location.**What you need:** Honestly, just a character sheet and a pencil, and even those I can provide if needed. Optional goodies are the player's handbook for convenience, and your own set of dice (though I have a few that can be used. All you really need is a good attitude and a love for roleplaying games.**Character Creation:** You're allowed to use any class or race option made available by Wizards of the Coast, including their Unearthed Arcana resources. This is fifth edition. If you're new, then I and the other players can help you out with character creation when you show up. If you'd like to make the character ahead of time, we're using standard array/27 point buy. DO NOT roll the character's stats.**Current Party:** I won't go into detail about their stories as that's up to the players themselves how much they divulge and when. The current make up is a Human Ranger who dual wields swords, a Halfling Arcane Trickster Rogue, and a Half-Elf Wild Magic Sorcerer. There is also a Half-Elf Bard, though she is unfortunately an infrequent player at the moment and occupies essentially a guest spot. I'd prefer new players not have classes already being used, but as long as there's enough difference between them, it's not a major issue.**Setting:** Details [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3l8kl7/the_world_for_my_dd_campaign_setting_sabah_a_land/) if you're interested in the read. Long story short, the story takes place post-apocalyptic magical war. It's a homebrew setting, so you don't need to know anything about the other D&D worlds. We're making plenty up as we go, so if there's an aspect you're interested in that hasn't been explored yet, you can bring it up so it can be incorporated into the campaign.That's about it. If there's any questions, then please let me know. The group is incredibly easy going and laid back. Every single person in the group so far has been completely new to either D&D or this particular edition, so we're all very newbie friendly. I can run at most about 7 players, and currently only have 3 (possibly 4) regulars. Not being able to show up for a session isn't a big deal and your character will quickly be caught up with the rest of the party.",Ignisiel,2,5,8,2/16/16 5:56,0.156423381,self.Charlotte,5007,Meetup,137

I can't leave my 74 year old mother who lives by herself without a phone, and I'm not really that keen on spending hundreds of dollars on a phone that has this very specific WiFi Calling feature, but that she pretty much uses like a Jitterbug!!!!Is there anyone out there who might have one of these hidden in a drawer somewhere that would be willing to sell it for under $75?I really don't trust Craigslist, and really only need something for a few months.Thanks so much",papillon24,4,7,4,2/9/16 22:44,0.121891572,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

It's off Tyvola Road, and it seems like they share their office with Oak Tree Marketing (I think that's the name).

(Don't know what that is?  Swing by /r/amateurradio and see what's up!)  We are a 501(c)3 / non-profit, if that happens to sway any decisions.  Anyways - - every year there is a nation-wide activity called ""[Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)"".  As the ARRL's website states, ""Field Day is part educational event, part operating event, part public relations event"".  Well, we got the operating part covered.  We know we'll have our radios and antenna towers, wire antennas, generators, etc., and we'll be on the air no matter where we wind up.  But where we're struggling the past few years is that public relations / educational portion - mainly due to location & audience.  Past years we have held field day at [Belk Scout Camp](https://www.mycampgrimes.org/directions_belk.phtml) (for a few years, I believe), we've done at at the [Park on Wilgrove](http://www.minthill.com/parks_recreation.php?Parks-Recreation-Park-on-Wilgrove-9) in Mint Hill, and most recently last year in Downtown Matthews (the field right across from Carolina Beer Temple).  Downsides to the scout camp - no outsiders at all came by.  There were some scouts there, but they paid us no attention either.  Downside to the park on Wilgrove - very few people go to that park it seems... Downside to Matthews - very few people came by (however, *I* blame this on the terrible weather we had that weekend, but no one else in the club wants to believe that was why).  So, what I am in search of is somewhere that has public visibility that isn't in an RF hole (essentially, not super below the average terrain around it), and isn't a Mecklenburg County Park (they require an off duty cop to be there the entire time or something ... wayyyy too much money).  We'd prefer to have running water / bathrooms, but portajohns are not out of the question.  We typically begin setup either mid-day on Friday, June 24, and leave that night (we usually have someone spend the night in their car/nearby keeping watch on things), then on Saturday morning we finish setup and begin operation around 1:00p and run 24 hours.  Any ideas on where to begin looking / contact for possible locations?",neocharles,46,23,5,2/4/16 22:25,-0.076204762,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

43roo9,Good Lawyer when it comes to Landlord/Tenant laws?,1,"Hi all,I am the tenant and my property management/landlord is trying to charge me for something I believe I should not be responsible for, in fact I think I need to take action due to an uninhabitable living conditions, but I am fairly new to Charlotte and have never had to get any lawyer for anything in my life so I could use some help.Free consultations a plus!EDIT: Folks asking me about the specific issue, see belowI moved into a house in Charlotte NC in September. The Property Management Company I was initially dealing with informed me that the house I was moving into was a recent Foreclosure purchased by the current landlord. There where a few issues upon moving in, but all in all for a Foreclosure was in pretty good shape. We noticed on the first day that out of our 2 toilets, 1 did not flush and the other barely flushed but shook violently. I also noticed a light on in the front yard (which, I did not know at the time, but it was the septic alarm) I have email correspondence the day after I moved in informing the Property Management of this. They sent someone to fix (not sure what he did) but the light went away and the toilets started to flush Yay! Since that time however, whenever it rains AT ALL, the septic alarm goes off, both the light and a loud buzzing noise. I mentioned it to the Property management again but noone was ever sent....eventually after days of no rain it usually cuts off. A few months after moving in our old Property Management was bought out by a different company. Even with them though, we have opened tickets about the issue, in fact between emails, texts, and maintenance tickets it is something we have brought up every month since moving in.Well lo and be hold, this weekend the light is on and no toilets are flushing. We get up with the Property Management and they FINALLY send someone to look at it again. The plumber says the pump is shot and not to use any water, so it wont back up into house. He gives the property Managment a quote of a couple thousand bucks and leaves. I get up with property management and they basically tell me to Go get a hotel for the weekend, because the landlord does not want to pay for it until he gets a second quote. I tell property management that I cannot afford a hotel upfront (they offered to reimburse). After one day in the house with no water I call them back. Keep in mind I have a 6 month pregnant wife who uses the bathroom alot, and an autistic daughter who is calmed by bathtime. When I call back I am told I am SOL and it may be days before someone can get out there, again they tell me to get a hotel, and again...I cant afford it as they gave me a limit of $85 dollars a night....on a weekend in Charlotte NC which is basically impossible. After hours of going back and forth they tell me that THEY will provide the hotel cost up front, it sucks because I have a house full of food I cant use and a ton of dirty clothes I cant wash....but showers and toilets are important so sure, the hotel deal sounds great. Checkedout of hotel this morning and came home right as the septic tank folks showed up. They were there to drain the tank, before the plumber came back to do what he had to do. Upon inspection the gentlemen tells me....nothing is broken it was just jammed up, apparently from wipes (I did not flush these) so he cleans it and viola....everything is great again. So I am thinking awesome, this is a much cheaper fix than the landlord was expecting so I guess he will be happy.I got to work a few minutes ago and they are CHARGING ME! They are saying it is tenant negligence and are trying to charge me for the Hotel stay, and the septic work. What in the world can I do, I couldnt even afford the hotel, much less this big ass bill. We are all caught up on rent, and never late.P.S. As a Side note last weekend during the snow, out heat broke. Once the vendor got to the house he was unable to fix the issue because he needed approval from a landlord....approval that he wouldnt get until 2 days later.",Diabetic_Manatee,8,22,14,2/2/16 8:49,0.081089086,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

I have read that the time to fill is now upwards of 2+ months due to the new mental health check requirements. A year ago (Feb '15) I got my three PPPs in 5 days. Hearing this increase is scaring me.I'm asking because I JUST bought a G42 and didn't have my purchase permit on me (thought my 3rd PPP from when I ordered them in 2015 was at home) so I couldn't do paperwork. I paid for the gun because it was a lightly used, fully cercoated, G42 with all the extras I wanted including TTI mag extenders and night sights and for the deal I got, I wasn't missing out. When I went home to get my last PPP I had left, I couldn't find it. I will still dig around and try to find my last permit, but it seems its gone. So now I could possibly be waiting for 2+ months to pick up a gun I've already paid for.EDIT: I found my last PPP last night after ripping through every important document I have. I picked up my G42 from Matt at The Arms Room (down South Blvd about 5-6mi from Uptown) this afternoon; now it's just waiting to be shot!

4bry35,"Even if you opposed Charlotte's ordinance, you shouldn't like what just happened - Sen. Jeff Jackson",1,"I'm starting to hear from constituents who say, ""But Jeff, I didn't like the Charlotte ordinance! Why should I care what just happened in Raleigh?""Because you just got played, that's why.The ordinance was used as political cover to pass a sweeping bill that was written in secret, unveiled at the last minute, rammed through in 12 hours, does all kinds of things that have nothing to do with the ordinance, has likely jeopardized our state's business recruitment, and has generally embarrassed us nationally.And here's my point: It was all because a few politicians saw this as a golden opportunity.The truth is, folks in Raleigh could not care less about the ordinance.The person who ran the bill in the Senate is a Republican running for Attorney General. His colleagues always let him give the first speech about the bill and you'll never guess who he blames for all this: the current Attorney General! You know, the same guy who *literally* had nothing to do with any of this.For good measure, the state Republican party released an attack ad against the current Attorney General on this issue yesterday morning, just as the special session got started. What a coincidence.Our Republican Governor - the one who originally refused to call a special session because he said he didn't want a broad bill that dealt with matters beyond the ordinance - signed the bill anyway, just before midnight. His political incentive for caving? His veto would have been overridden and his legislative agenda would have been blocked as punishment for even trying to stand firm. And even though he doesn't like this bill, he'll still campaign on it. Watch.The Republican leadership in the state House and Senate is terrified of a Donald Trump nomination. They think this is a great issue to protect their gerrymandered seats, so they're going to use this issue to run absolutely vicious ads - the type we've really never seen before in North Carolina - this fall. So get ready for that.Bottom-line: Even if you strongly opposed the ordinance, please know that this bill wound up having almost nothing to do with it. These guys grabbed your banner and marched right off a cliff, on your behalf.EDIT:Getting some fair questions about what was added onto the bill in addition to the bathroom piece.  I should have included that in my original post - my fault.1. The bill repealed every non-discrimination ordinance in the state, including those that prohibit shops and restaurants from discriminating against people based on race, gender, or religion.  It nominally replaced these ordinances with a statewide version, but there's no enforcement mechanism (worst case scenario = non-binding mediation, as compared to Charlotte's worst case scenario, which was an injunction).  So the bill effectively removed any legal penalty for denying service to African Americans or women.  The bill also nixes a bunch of other local ordinances that have nothing to do with discrimination, like anything to do with employment or wages.2. Related to the above point, it eliminated the ""private right of action,"" (i.e., the ability to sue) for being fired because of your race, gender, or religion.  You can sue in federal court, but no longer in state court.  I believe it's now just us and Mississippi in that boat.3. In requiring students to use bathrooms that align with their anatomical gender (something the Charlotte ordinance, which did not apply to schools or churches, didn't touch), the bill jeopardizes billions in federal money NC receives through Title 9.  Tennessee tossed out this same idea earlier this week out of this concern.",JeffJacksonNC,25,94,156,3/24/16 23:10,0.053386243,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics,60

The aspect of **mandatory** puts too much power into the hands of bureaucrats and takes it away from developers...who are taking the risk on the project.  Even if that risk comes with great profits.  That said, Charlotte needs to move forward to solve the housing issue for low and medium income residents.  I think a good solution would be for Charlotte leaders to take on the issue with a wide net and look at both private development zoning, transportation and public projects such as green space and housing as a single fork rather than individual swords.  Identify several locations around the city where the City of Charlotte holds the title to land and where transportation can be improved.  In these areas, work with developers to redevelop those parcels while at the same time improving access to the job centers through public transportation.  In other words, don't mandate income levels in some projects because you have the ability to deny a zoning request.  Rather, create opportunities for different projects to become profitable and beneficial to the community you want to support.  What say you?",justwanttolurk,20,18,4,3/23/16 20:38,0.084258297,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

I work security for a couple of bars/clubs uptown, and I just wanted to let you guys know we've had a bunch of phones stolen, some of them right out of women's purses. Unfortunately, we can't catch everyone - it's dark, and there are a lot of people and things we're already looking out for.So here's what you can do if you plan to go out uptown(or anywhere, for that matter), especially this weekend with the pub crawl:1. Don't plug your phone up inside. You've had a few drinks, your phone battery is at 5%, I get it. You'll end up walking away and leaving it, and someone will take it, no matter how nice a place you're in. Let your phone die - that drunk text to your ex at 3 am isn't worth it anyway.2. Ladies, keep your purses slung on your shoulder in front of you, and keep them zipped/snapped up. If it's behind you, someone can take your phone out of your purse and you'll never know. 3. Don't give your purse/phone/whatever to a friend if you're going to go dance and they're not. They are not as worried about the security of your phone, I promise you that.4. If you see someone suspicious, maybe who isn't holding a drink, just standing around, or if you see someone glancing into women's purses behind them, point them out to the bouncers. **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CONFRONT SOMEONE.** Even if you are 1000000% sure you saw them take a phone or you think you caught them in the act, come talk to the security. If you confront them, you're just gonna get yourself thrown out. We will not go searching someone based on your word alone. 5. **SERIOUSLY, DO NOT CONFRONT ANYONE.** We are trying to catch them in the act so that we can hand them over to Charlotte's finest and they can go to jail. If you confront them, you'll just spook them off and they'll go somewhere else, or just wait a while to try again. And as soon as that happens, we're gonna have to ask you to leave for causing a scene.We security guys are much nicer than you think. We are there to make sure you're safe, even from your overly-drunk self, and to make sure everyone's having a great time. Come talk to us if you see an issue like this or any other kind. Have fun and be safe this weekend! Oh, and feel free to tip...",BouncerThrowawayclt,1,35,38,3/9/16 21:26,0.169668737,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

48swbb,My list of reasons to move to Charlotte,1,"Charlotte, North Carolina is slowly growing in popularity as more and more people decide to move to the area. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are single, part of a couple or moving as a family â€“ the area boasts of features that make it one of the best places to settle down. So what exactly can residents brag about Charlotte, NC? Here is a list:**Melting Pot**The best thing about Charlotte: the fact that no one who lives here is actually from Charlotte. The city is home to thousands of people who came from different parts of the country and even the world. The lack of a solid culture is actually a good thing because it turns into an excellent melting pot of any race and age. As a result, you will find yourself meeting all kinds of people, exposed to all kinds of food and essentially enjoying all kinds of activities and pleasure not limited to just a specific region.**Weather**The weather is perfect! All four seasons are experienced in Charlotte, but not in extensive levels. During summer, the weather is not incredibly hot and during winter, there is enough snow to enjoy the season without obliterating too much of the road. Spring and fall are, of course, equally present and actually beautiful considering how Charlotte is still home to lots of trees and plants. Whether you live in the actual city or a little farther from the center, you will be able to enjoy the changing colors of the leaves as the season changes from one to the next.**Traffic is Non-Existent**Traffic is an ever-increasing problem that seems to be existent in every major city. If you are tired with all the traffic, however, Charlotte will be able to give you the kind of drive that affords leisure and comfort. No need to worry about an hour-long drive just to get some groceries since the roads here are far from congested. In fact, depending on where you live, it is perfectly possible to just walk to places for supplies.**Jobs**Charlotte is a banking capital, but donâ€™t imagine it to be one of those strait-laced cities where everyone rushes from one place to other wearing suits. Beyond the banking center, the people of the city are pretty laid-backed and enjoy the kind of life quality in New York but without all the drawbacks. If you are thinking about moving to Charlotte, then you will be glad to know that there are lots of jobs to go around, ensuring that you will find a means of support when you finally move here.**The Beer**Charlotte boasts of home-brewed beers unlike anything else you will find in the country. Sure, popular bars carry all kinds of beer â€“ even the ones that you have gotten used to in your old watering hole. Additional brands are available, however, and if you will just try one of them, you will find that the home-grown drinks are better â€“ and taste more of Charlotte.**Active Outdoors**There are around 10 mountains nearby and tons of outdoor activities to keep you in shape. Hiking trails, mountain climbing, biking trails, and even chasing the white rapids are available in Charlotte. The Rapids are a favorite for many, especially since the US National Whitewater Center is located nearby. It offers a perfect simulation of whitewater rafting minus all the possible dangers and problems you will encounter in the actual scenery.**NASCAR**Not everyone is a fan of NASCAR but if you are, then you will be glad to know that Charlotte is NASCAR heaven. Also, if you are not content with just watching the race â€“ you can actually participate in it â€“ or at least, gain some experience. There are some services that let you enjoy a few laps for a fee.**Food, Glorious Food**The fact that Charlotte is a melting pot of so many culture means that you will be able to find all sorts of food in their restaurants. Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and more â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter what kind of food you prefer because you will find them all in Charlotte. There are also restaurants strictly for the vegetarians or vegans so the place welcomes practically anyone with varied dietary preferences.**Market and Relaxation**Residents of Charlotte always look forward to the first Friday of the month because this is when all kinds of food trucks come over for a city-wide fiesta. There are morning markets and farmer markets, both of which sell some of the freshest and most affordable food items that you canâ€™t get anywhere else. Of course, that doesnâ€™t mean the market is limited to those days. The fact is that they are open all year round, featuring a strip of stalls and cafes that serve all kinds of food for your pleasure. It is easy to eat healthy here as well as live healthy, especially with all the spas and services designed to help you relax.**Nightlife**For the singles out there thinking about moving to Charlotte, look forward to an excellent nightlife but without the usual danger that comes from living in the big city. Charlotte is host to some of the most active yet safe bars which can be packed every Friday and Saturday night. No worries if you are hoping to meet that special someone in Charlotte â€“ the city is home to lots of singles so you can definitely find some action here.**Family Facilities**Of course, those who are moving to the city together with their kids will be happy to know that Charlotte is incredibly welcoming to families. The real estate prices here are within reasonable range and the children will benefit from the near-quiet lifestyle of the neighborhood. There are also lots of schools for elementary and high school students, each one featuring an excellent education system.

The food the atmosphere the service all came together to make for an amazing dinning experience. If I was cheating a picking a before dinner drink place I would with Peculiar Rabbit or Fahrenheit. Watch sun set with a cocktail. End of the road: **Montford Billiards** I have been living in and going out in Charlotte since 2011 and I still don't think I have a favorite bar. I could have just as much fun at the Blind Pig as I could at say Prohibition or perhaps Kennedy's. But I have had some very good times at Montford Billiards.

4fn2zx,Pat McCory alone does not deserve all the hate.,1,"After discussing the issue with a few friends of mine, I thought I'd look into powers of the Governor of North Carolina, specifically veto powers.  What I found made me rethink all the hate that Gov. McCory has been getting.  Apparently, each bill is read three times in each house and then sent to the governor for approval to become a law.  The governor does have the power to veto a bill.  If he does veto a bill, the bill goes back to the house from which it originated for reconsideration.  But then, the house can take a vote on it (yays and nays) and pass the bill into a law anyway if three-fifths of the members of the house present and voting, agree to pass the bill.  The HB2 bill passed the state House 82-26 and the state Senate 32-0 (with none of the Senate Democrats voting).  Even if McCory had vetoed this controversial bill, it would have passed anyway since the House and the Senate had more than three-fifths of the vote.  During his time as governor, McCory has vetoed bills before that became a law anyway.  Maybe he was pressured into signing this so that any bill he proposes is not completely shat on down the line in the houses or maybe he actually believes in this craptastic bill.  Either way, he alone does not deserve all the hate and blame.  Each and every representative of the House and the Senate equally deserve all the hate.  I kinda feel bad for the guy because he had no authority to begin with.  EDIT:  For everyone who still thinks there's nobody to blame but McCory, here's (http://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/25/1506355/-NC-HB2-Anti-LGBT-Bill-The-Roll-Call-Vote-And-Time-To-Shame-Some-Bad-Democrats) a list of people who voted to pass this bill.  People who YOU voted for.  People who are supposed to speak on YOUR behalf.  You want to point fingers that actually means something?  Find the person who represents you and ask them why they voted to pass this shitty bill.

No loud ass noises from speakers, the park is lit up really well, and just fun in general.  Or, another cool thing would be to go to a uncrowded observatory and just go look at the stars for a couple hours with a friend.  I would love to do something like that, but I just don't feel like that exists around here.  All I ever really see is bar's and clubs and that is it.  All noisy.  It would just be fun to do something at night without that.Can someone maybe point to something good to do besides a bar or club?  Somewhere one could just go and sit and enjoy a good/not loud environment?  Like, a lounge type area.  Or a place you can go nearby to go look at the stars through a telescope?  I just want to do something different than a bar or club with a friend after 10pm.

You would think that if CMS were to lease school land that was purchased with tax dollars they would find a way to open the opportunity for all CMS students but that might hurt the bottom line for David Koerner and Ike Belk. Some may be asking why would an Olympic Training facility build out a facility in South Charlotte rather than near the other Olympic facility that the city invested so much money in.  Well the answer is pretty simple.  There is not enough wealthy parents out that way to shuttle their kids to that campus to chase the dream.  This location is the sweet spot for their bottom line.

I have very few friends outside of that group and I lost all the friends I had within the group when I left. Being more of an introverted person, I'm a bit overwhelmed with going to bars or clubs to try to meet people. I'd also like to get to know friends on a deeper level. I've tried going to a couple of Meetups and yoga classes, but I haven't found that it's very easy to have a conversation or really meet someone in those situations.Does anyone have any suggestions of where I could go to meet new people and make friends in the area? I live near Plaza Midwood and NoDa.  And even though I grew up in a religious environment, I'm a very open-minded person. I'm open to trying new things and developing new interests. Most of my current hobbies are individual type things, which is part of why it's been hard for me to meet new people. I love to read, listen to music, watch Netflix, I'm learning guitar.

4dj456,PayPal pulled off a genius political stunt today in Charlotte,1,"I think PayPal pulled off a genius political stunt today in Charlotte. Here is why we call it a stunt... Paypal only agreed to come to Charlotte after holding out for Millions in corporate incentives ($3.7M to be exact plus $480,000 in community college incentives)Under McCrory's HB2 bill PayPal could have chosen to fill all 400 jobs with LGBT members if and provide bathroom and non-discrimination policies designed for their employees, company and shareholders but instead they forfeited the opportunity for political posturing.I think they missed the opportunity to make a difference and instead they look like hypocrites. Last month Paypal announced its expansion into Cuba, a country in which homosexuals and transgenders are imprisoned and tortured and currently do business in 26 counties where it is illegal to be gay and many of these countries kill the LGBT. Last week the state of Nebraska failed to pass a PayPal endorsed LGBT rights bill. Why is PayPal CEO Dan Schulman criticizing McCrory and keeping silent on the bill where his company hosts its Worldwide Operations Center? Should Nebraskan employees be packing their bags for California or Vermont?Paypal today sided with Chad Sevearance Turner, the Charlotte resident who was convicted for sexual assault of young boys, instead of the 69% of North Carolinians who support the safety and privacy of the women and children of Charlotte. It is beginning to look like Schulman was in the right spot to make McCrory look bad as a favor to Obama or the Human Rights CampaignI think Paypal is ridiculous, and they deserve to have millions of people who have common sense about women not sharing bathrooms with grown men boycott and cancel their Paypal accounts. I cancelled ours today and encourage you to do the same! See the map anaspiringengineer posted down below.....",Jimothyquick,1,12,0,4/6/16 7:25,-0.023326432,self.Charlotte,5007,HB2,85

Are there any pub/club/bar crawls in Charlotte that happen on a weekly basis? Ones where I wouldn't feel awkward going alone?I'm open to any age range for the demographics whether it's the college scene or the older scene or somewhere in the middle. I'm not really sure if any demographic would be willing to except me (no career, still working on my bachelors) but I'm willing to try. I just want to make friends and would prefer to meet girls and see where it leads. If I don't put myself out there then nothing will change....... Also, I think I would feel uncomfortable going to a bar or club by myself  (even though I enjoy them from time to time), so if anybody knows of any pub crawls that are good for single people, please let me know!Any help is appreciated, thank you reddit Charlotte!",wanttomeetnewpeople,1,5,1,5/31/16 10:43,0.07122734,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

It has also been shown to reduces motorcycle vs. automobile accidents during congestion and at traffic stops.  Lane splitting is riding between cars at a slow speed when traffic has come to a crawl, under 15mph, or traffic has come to a complete stop.  The general rule is that a bike should not exceed 10 mph while traveling between vehicles.Filtering is moving up between stopped vehicles at red lights. The issues I see arising are those of the motorcycling who will abuse the privilege and exceed safe speeds while filtering. Another issue I see is the air of intolerance from non motorcyclists, who will try to enforce the law of their own accord.As a motorcyclist myself, I feel that lane splitting should be legalized in North Carolina as a whole.",Ridethepig101,1,14,0,5/29/16 7:00,0.11875,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

This violation was of me parking at the no parking area 3.5 months ago.. so i received a delinquency notice on 5/19 and violation issue date was 2/5. Now,  I'm not sure why this ticket was issued at first place because i never left the car unattended and never parked car at the no parking area.  I was going with the flow of oncoming traffic and moving along, picked up my friend and left on the date 2/5. Now,  i received this delinquency notice, there is obviously no contact information on it.  But search online i called the number and their standard answer was to email at parkingtickets@cltairport.com. so i emailed them three times already to appeal or cancel this ticket because I've not violated any law.. also note that i can't appeal online since it passed 30 days of issue date. So the only option for me is to email them.  I again called that number provided on the website, she was pissed of for some reason and said they are backed up with lot of emails and she said wait for them to respond.  But i don't see any response til date.  Also i can tell that they have read the email 10 times already but haven't responded to me yet. Now,  having said that,  i don't want to pay because there is no violation. At the same time don't want to affect credit history because of this notice of this small amount.

Any suggestions on housing for 1 month, I'm pretty open to whatever as long as it is relatively safe.  Also any way to avoid pet fees for the 1 month?  I would love to stay for 600 or less but I have a feeling from what I've seen that may not be possible.The more important question is in July we would like to rent a house, we were hoping at least 2 br, about 1500 for the budget, how feasible would this be?  What areas would be good areas to live in and any to definitely avoid?  I would like to live somewhere more social, but am open to anything.

Both of us will sticky the thread and we will exchange various questions and answers regarding our ways of life and about our country.  [**Here**](https://np.reddit.com/r/iranian/wiki/exchanges) is  the big list of all the exchanges that we have done so far. *Take a look*, you might be surprised by whom we have met before.The mods of /r/AskAnAmerican and /r/iranian have agreed to a national exchange happening in both subreddits from **June 11-18**.If you feel that at the end of the day, this post has negative feedback (i.e. NO), then I wish you all a good day. This thread was to see how the reception is by the people of this subreddit. Vox populi.P.S. If you are confused as to why there are 2 Iranian subreddits, it's because there was a schism and we split because of mod drama. It is best if we do not talk about it hence it might become a burden on us in the long run. /r/iranian is the subreddit that has been doing the cultural exchanges after the split. Mamnoon (Thank you).**If you believe that this post has enough positive support, then do the following**-1. This is your subreddit and it has it's own rules. The date is far away and the location is in a different subreddit. In order to remind yourselves, discuss on how you plan to remember it. Some mods that I have encountered (and I really mean a lot of mods) have declined to do sticky reminders because it does not go with the rules of their subreddit. Fair.2.  I encourage you and your fellow statesmen to spread this  (x-post) to other subreddits within *this state* (only). The more Americans we reach, the better. Please share with medium to large subreddits (>1000 subscribers and >6 active users). **Guidelines for this exchange**1. This subreddit will take no active part in the exchange.

This leaves me with 2 questions:Does the 77X stop at any other locations besides the ones shown on the schedule? There looks to be a stop on Sam Furr Rd 1/2 mile away from the NorthCross Park and Ride but it is not listed on the schedule which makes me wonder if there are any others.Does anyone have any suggestions on how to cover the 1 or 2 miles from where we may live to the NorthCross Park and Ride without using a car? From what I hear, most months of the year 1 mile is too far to walk in the Charlotte heat (true?). Is Uber reliable enough in the LKN area to be used every morning to catch a bus? Does anyone have any experience with the Village Rider? The idea that it will pick people up within 3/4 of a mile seems outlandish to me.Thanks everyone.",nyse2041,2,6,1,6/12/16 23:16,0.157670455,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

4v0z6k,Try a free hot sauce sample from NC entrepreneur,1,"This hot sauce is called Trini Pepper Sauce, and is a recipe from my family thatâ€™s been passed down from five generations. Every time I took a trip back to Trinidad and Tobago from NC, my grandmother would send hot sauce back with me to share with my friends, and it made me start to think about how I could share it with the world.&nbsp;I just got back from Trinidad and was finally able to secure sourcing of the perfect Scotch Bonnet and Scorpion Peppers for this sauce (it took a while to find the right ones, I can tell more if youâ€™re interested). Iâ€™m doing a free limited sample giveaway. Please try the sauce and tell me what you think! &nbsp;**To get the sauce**Just give us your name and mailing address in this [link!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQJvBgdgMKIIx5mB6TzCGjR6J_dgksGzQAhv4YCGbH5whV5Q/viewform?c=0&w=1) I'd also appreciate any feedback, there's always room for improvement and variety. Please e-mail staff@trinipeppersauce.co with any suggestions/questions.&nbsp;**The Trini Pepper Sauce Taste**This hot sauce is referred to as â€˜peppa sauceâ€™ in Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago is a small country of two islands in the caribbean known for its local cuisine and carnival. Every family has their own recipe and itâ€™s typically added to meals to add flavor and heat. Our peppa sauce is made with freshly picked Scotch Bonnet and Scorpion Peppers imported from Trinidad. It's exciting to introduce a Trinidad style hot sauce in North Carolina, where Texas Pete is the popular sauce, because the flavor is different, and people love it. The flavor is smooth with hints of garlic, culantro (trinidad cilantro), and papaya. It goes great with chicken, eggs, fish, pizzas, wings, and more. Let us know what you like it best on!&nbsp;**Why I want to give you free sample**Iâ€™ve hosted local tasting events, received positive feedback and would like to gain some more. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, as well as any feedback on how we could improve. I plan to roll the momentum and feedback toward my Kickstarter campaign.

Incredibly flavorful...could even try to pick out all the ingredients. -  Mike H.*&nbsp;*Love the color. Separates itself from your conventional red hot sauce which gets monotonous and expected. The flavors were new and exciting as well. -  Sameer A.*&nbsp;*It has a really unique and fresh flavor. I think that's your selling point -- it doesn't taste processed or sugary and lets the ingredients show through. - Allyson S.*&nbsp;*The spiciness is making me sweat... but the aftertaste is bangin' - Esther L.*&nbsp;*I like the flavor a lot, I feel it is very versatile compared to many existing products. Thanks for letting us try it out! - Jeremy W.*&nbsp;*Most dope sauce I've ever had. With a great story behind it.

If you've been to Abari, you might have seen a large set of cabinets with flat screens near the X-Men machine. I would hope that if you saw it you gave it a try. If not:> Killer Queen is a 5v5 competitive strategy game with similar game mechanics to Joust (Arcade Game) and> Quidditch (like, from Harry Potter). Some have described it as a Real Time Strategy game, but to me that > sounds too much like Starcraft. Calling it a MOBA is probably counterproductive, too, but I could see someone > making the argument. Each team competes to win the game in one of three ways that involve dexterity, > strategy, and mind games. It's generally easy to learn and has a high skill ceiling.Those are my words, not the developers'. If you head over to www.killerqueenarcade.com there's lots more including pics and video. While you're there, you might notice that there are only a handful of locations in the WORLD that have KQ, so we're very lucky to be a part of the scene.The Tournament this Sunday will only be our 2nd. If you're new to the game and want to try with some more experienced, enthusiastic players, this will be a great opportunity. The teams will be semi-random in order to spread out the skill pool.

Am I right to be concerned? Do we cancel our move?Hi r/Charlotte!My wife and I currently live in Boston. This past winter, we came to the conclusion had enough of the city and it was time to move on. So began our search for a new place to call home.Long story short, we eventually settled on your fine city, with plans to move after our wedding in September (Yes, we're having a wedding after we've been married for over 2 years. Because, reasons). Then HB2 happened.At first I was really worried. Without getting into how I feel about the law itself (I'd prefer if this thread did not turn into a political debate.), the immediate wave of news detailing musicians cancelling NC shows, and businesses putting plans to expand on hold, was a huge concern for me. I'm an accountant, and one reason we chose Charlotte was the growing economy. But, I thought to myself, *Surely, this won't last forever. And the economic pressure might force change* (Naive? Maybe.). *If it gets really bad we can just move again* Maybe this is a poor sentiment, but the fact that we could easily leave if this starts to have a noticeable economic effect on us was the reason we ultimately decided to stick with our plan (That and the Charlotte area seems great. We've already found a neighborhood we really like in Huntersville, no more New England winters, and we have had nothing but great experiences when visiting).However, every new story of Charlotte getting screwed because of this law has chipped away at my resolve. Last night, I was reading about the estimated economic impact of losing the NBA All-Star game, and I found myself thinking, *It's not too late to change your mind.* So, I could use a little perspective from someone who is actually there. Are Charlotte businesses already feeling the impact of these cancellations?  Does it make sense to be concerned that the City's economic growth might stall because of this?How has HB2 and the subsequent backlash affected you?Should we still move to Charlotte?",Less-Than_Three,1,26,3,7/23/16 1:20,0.110643523,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

In Gaston County,1,"This might be a long shot, but is anyone here using T-Mobile and\or MetroPCS in Gaston County? I'm one of those no-contract phone people, and this week MetroPCS announced what might be [the greatest $99 phone ever](http://www.cnet.com/news/zte-zmax-pro-lands-at-metropcs-for-jaw-droppingly-low-99/). It's so good that I'm seriously considering switching. But I live in GC, and am worried about coverage there (not that it could be worse than VM\Sprint, but I digress). I assume T-Mobile is A-OK in much of Charlotte proper. While I'm here, I might as well ask: if anyone *is* using MetroPCS, how do they compare to T-Mobile branded service? I ask because although Sprint owns Virgin Mobile and Boost, Sprint's tower-sharing deals only apply to Sprint accounts. So if you're in East Bumble, SC on the way to Myrtle, a Sprint phone might have full service (via a Verizon tower), while a VM phone will have no service at all.Thanks!

Pick something that's only a few miles/kilometers long and see how difficult it is for you. Everyone hikes at different speeds and prefers different terrain. Hiking to a mountain top is the classic adventure, but down into valleys or towards waterfalls can be rewarding too. Remember that elevation gain is equally important to distance. 1000 ft of elevation gain will typically add 1 hour to a hike. The average hiking speed is 2 miles per hour, depending on conditions / terrain / fitness. * Out-and-back is the popular type of hike. This is where you start at the trailhead, where you park your vehicle, and hike to a certain location - then turn around and hike the same path back. This is ideal for beginners because you know what to expect on the 2nd half of the hike. It also allows you to turn around at any point to shorten the trip. Loop (start and end at the same place but never re-hiking the same section) and Thru/Section (start and end at different places) are other popular types of hikes.* Build up the miles / elevation of these day hikes. Explore more tails and learn the skills of hiking. Understanding how much water to carry, what footwear to use, time management, what gear is required in different conditions, weather forecasting, navigation, and others are critical to successful backpacking and day trips alike.

If you live in the area and would like to have your name added to the list of supporters, please PM me with your name & neighborhood and I'll add you.Here's the content of the letter:>>The below signatories would like to voice our approval of the new cell tower proposed at Cross and Crown Lutheran Church.  Mobile phone reception is widely regarded by residents as abysmal in most of the neighborhoods along Sardis Road between highway 51 and Sardis Road North.  This lack of service causes problems ranging from lack of 911 services during power outages to reliance on expensive land lines and carrier-issued microcells.  Additionally, a plague of makeshift â€œcell phone lotsâ€ù has arisen in several neighborhoods â€“ Coachman Ridge as a prime example â€“ wherein drivers park at the entrance to neighborhoods to avoid having their calls drop.  This causes traffic problems that will eventually result in accidents.  Finally, the income from the tower will help Cross and Crown, a respected church in our local community.

4sitrw,Interesting idea for local fantasy football enthusiasts,1,"... or maybe I'm just far too into fantasy football and crazy for thinking this is even possible.So I listen to a lot of the fantasy football channel on SiriusXM and they were talking last year around this time about cool things different leagues do. It got me to thinking and I came up with an idea that I'd actually be interested in trying out. I'd like to try to set up a 36 team, 3 tiered, ""league."" What I mean is something similar to what soccer does with promotion and relegation. How we'd do it:The first season would basically be 3 brand new redraft leagues. Really nothing different but each would have to have the same rules/scoring system. To start the second season, we'd take the top third of each of the first season to create the premier league. The middle third of each would comprise the 2nd tier and same thing for the 3rd tier.After that, each league would be done much like English soccer. Bottom portion of the premier league gets relegated to 2nd tier and top of 2nd tier promoted. Same for 2nd and third tiers. The way I have it envisioned is three 12 team leagues (pretty much has to be a multiple of 3 just to set up year 2). Year 1, everyone pays the same amount (say $50; maybe plus $5 contribution to get some kind of trophy or something). After that, I'd prefer tier 2 and 3 to pay maybe $5 and $10 extra or something similar to pay winners in tiers 1 and 2 extra. After all, there should be some kind of monetary bonus for winning the better leagues.I don't want to try to do this whole thing on my own because it just sounds like a whole lot more to try to organize than I have time (or the desire to do). If a couple of you might be interested in organizing people and discussing some details, I think it could be a really fun idea.

4sctyn,"Dear Charlotte Motorists,",1,"I bike to work. I've biked to work everywhere I've lived. I've found Charlotte to have the most hostile motorists in the five cities I've lived and biked.  In one commute in Charlotte, I encounter as much rage, horns, cursing, and aggressive driving as I've encountered in five years in different cities. I'm entitled to bike on the road. North Carolina law and Charlotte ordinances support that truth. Here are some tips and tricks to dealing with cyclists on the road:1. Get your tiny toddler hands off of your horn and put your little cocktail sausage fingers back onto the steering wheel of your F-150, shift into another lane, and pass me in another lane. 2. Pass at a safe distance in a separate lane. Do not aggressive veer into the lane I am in and try to intimidate me. I promise; I am not the problem keeping you from getting to work sooner. It is the several hundred thousand cars on the road doing that. 3. Keep your window rolled-up.  I do not need to or want to hear your opinion of me cycling in front of you.  I do not need to learn any new four-letter words4.  Think about how many cars impede your progress everyday and how much easier and faster it is to pass a bicycle compared to a car. 5. I like cycling on the same road as you even less than you do. If you want to stop sharing the road with me, join me supporting the bike infrastructure this city desperately needs. I would love to cycle on a beautiful path on the way to my workplace separate from the noxious, loud behemoth you drive to work. 6.

4rf2eo,"""So, what just happened with HB2?""",1,"Session ended for the year late Friday night. There had been talk all week of a modification to HB2, but nothing surfaced. Going into Friday night's session - the last voting session of the year - we were told to ""expect nothing controversial.""It was getting late, about 9:30 p.m. We finished voting on a noncontroversial bill and moved to the next one. A senator spoke to the new bill for about 20 seconds, describing what sounded like a very technical and uncontroversial matter - and never mentioning HB2.  (The bill had only been introduced as that senator began speaking to it.  No one had a chance to review it prior to that moment.)  He finished his short speech and it was immediately called for a vote.  We were about two seconds away from locking in the voting process when another senator jumped up and put the brakes on - he had spotted that this was the HB2 bill. They had introduced it so quickly that it almost came to vote without anyone realizing what was happening, which was the whole idea.Our senator asked if we could take a 30 minute recess to read the bill. He was denied. So he continued to ask questions to give the rest of us in the minority party time to quickly read the bill and figure out what was in it.As it turned out, it only did one thing: it partially restored the right to sue your employer in state court if you're fired because of your race, gender, religion, age, or disability. HB2 had originally thrown out that right, making NC and Mississippi the only two states without it. This bill restored it, but it also cut the statute of limitations for filing your claim from three years (which is what it had been prior to HB2) to one year.I, and the rest of the minority party, voted against it for two reasons. First, it unnecessarily narrowed the statute of limitations. Second, we continue to believe that any legislation that does not address the core issue behind HB2 - which is discrimination against the LGBT community - is insufficient.Now session has ended without any real action on HB2. It appears the majority party has decided to accept whatever economic consequences this may bring to our state.",JeffJacksonNC,25,20,223,7/6/16 5:41,0.070350329,self.Charlotte,5007,HB2,85

4r6n6u,USNWC R:/Charlotte Meetup 4th of July Fireworks and Music,1,"[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/7VI6ZQC.jpg)It's the biggest night of the year at the USNWC.  Great music, good beer (bring money and patience...although protip, the bike barn and the kayak barn have much shorter lines than the main beer garden, because no one thinks to look over there, and they also sell beer), great fireworks, and a chill vibe.It's a really pretty venue, not far at all from Uptown Charlotte, but feels like a world away.  USNWC is my family's church, our country club, our gym, my oldest daughter's workplace, etc., we know it backwards, forwards, and inside-out.  We are pretty much always there.  So if you have a question about what to do there, I can absolutely try to answer.As far as the Meetup, my family will be there pretty early today to set up chairs near the band, and we will put r/Charlotte signs on the chairs so you guys know where to set up.  We will try to put the chairs in a pretty big semi-circle so that when it gets crowded, you can set up inside the semi-circle if there isn't room anywhere else.Fair warning, though, we probably won't be IN the chairs much until around 7 or 8.  Maybe off and on, but there's a lot of great activities to do there, and we also have a great hangout we know about that is away from the crowds, and if we see you by the chairs before the sun has gone down enough to make the area comfortable in the heat, we will show you where it is.Last time we had the MeetUp, I realized one important thing...so I'm going to just get this out there, if this is your first MeetUp.  You will probably feel kind of awkward about that first moment of saying, ""Hey, are you the stranger I talk to on the Internet?"" or whatever, but try not to be.  It ended up being so much fun!  Everyone was very different, but that's partly what made it a very interesting evening. ALSO:  Be there somewhat early tonight, because last night parking hit capacity, and parking ALWAYS hits capacity on the 4th, usually by 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  So either bring plenty of water or money for water because you'll be there until past ten waiting for traffic to die down enough to drive home and you don't want to get dehydrated (can you tell I'm a mom of three?....you can, right?)Last night, the parking lot was packed getting out, so we ended up getting back out of the car and walking around for about half an hour until it died down a bit.  Tonight we just won't bother getting in the car until 10:45ish.  Also, they redirect traffic to take a detour to get on Mt. Holly to 485, so make sure you have a way to charge your phone for directions if you've drained it SnapChatting fireworks.I'm excited about today, I love 4th Of July.  I hope some of you are able to make it.  We're going to be there all day, even in this heat and humidity.  We're going to take advantage of the new offer USNWC has for pass buyers and season pass holders where they give you part of the canopy tour that is normally $80 for free, you just have to sign up for it when you get there, just like you used to sign up for a raft time.

She told me she didn't feel anything for me since the beginning, but stuck with me because i was "" a great guy"". My feelings were real, but all of that felt like a lie, and it really does hurt. We had a 4th of july trip i took off extra time for, but now obviously its cancelled. She still wants to be friends( i thought i wanted to also, but i just realized i wasn't letting go), and tries to talk to me everyday, even though she said we should take some space, so i've decided to start ignoring her to try to move on. On top if it, 2 days later i had a spasm in my right leg, which paralyzed my up movement on my foot(drop foot) so now i have trouble walking.All of this hit me within a couple days, and i've been really up and down lately. A lot of the friends i know are too busy, or don't care enough to support me through this, and it's hard for me to do things alone in this state, so I'm looking for supportive people who might be able to help me out.A little about myself, I'm a 27year old male, I work in IT, and love the outdoors.

50ewig,Have some questions for an experienced Landlord/Rental Management Company Insider/Lawyer that works with Landlords,1,"Hey,Apologies upfront if this is answered elsewhere, but I didn't see much in Charlotte regarding renting on the landlord side. I'm thinking about actively managing and renting my own house out (instead of using a management company), and I am having trouble finding NC or Mecklenburg-specific rules, suggestions, etc. So if you have experience, I have a few questions! All of my questions are based on random articles I've read, tidbits of county laws I've found, and my personal experience, so if I'm way off the mark on something, let me know!**Background**: I bought a house to live in, but due to some external issues (I wanted to do an addition, but the HDC said no), I moved out and want to rent the house out full-time. I travel about 50% of the time for work, but when Iâ€™m home Iâ€™m available essentially 24/7. Iâ€™m also available by phone pretty much all the time. Iâ€™ve been Airbnbing the house for a few months, and while Iâ€™m tired of cleaning up after people all the time, I donâ€™t mind putting in the upfront work of getting a tenant and answering calls. The house is a single-family home that was completely renovated a couple years ago and (in my opinion) is very nice and modern. While Iâ€™d love to make bank on the house, itâ€™s more about having good tenants that will take care of the property while just covering my costs (until the HDC gets their head out of their ass and I can do what I like. Or I give up. Either way.) On the same vein, I want to make sure Iâ€™m doing this the right way. *Ok, so.*â€¢	Besides registering with CMPD, is there anything I need to do with the city or police to get started?â€¢	Why did you decide to actively manage instead of use a company?â€¢	Any sites or outlets I should use to advertise besides the usual Zillow, Craigslist, Padmapper, etc? Any tips on how best to advertise? Do you use a lock-box to allow people to look at the house themselves or do you go with prospective tenants? Do you work with realtors or no?â€¢	Do you have a lawyer that you work with for evictions, handling security deposits, etc? Do you keep them on retainer, or just know that they are available? Any recommendations on firms or lawyers?â€¢	Do you have the law firm hold onto the security deposit, or where do you hold onto it?â€¢	Do you recommend using anything other than the standard NC lease? Anything extra that you recommend be covered in the lease?â€¢	Most management companies use a credit and background check (ie using a service like Mysmartmove). Do you do anything extra? If someone has bad/no credit, do you have other verifications or do you automatically deny?â€¢	I personally have no problem allowing pets (I had dogs at my house before deciding to rent), but do you like/allow them? Anything I should know ahead of time other than the pet addendum? â€¢	Do you have a dedicated handyman for repairs? Where did you find them? Any recommendations on specific people? Do you keep them on retainer with a contract or any sort, or is it all piece-work? Do you try to do work yourself before calling them, or do you use them whenever thereâ€™s an issue? Any qualifications that you recommend they have (like being a certified electrician, being bonded, etc)?â€¢	Anything you think a new landlord should know? Any reasons I should definitely use a management company instead of managing myself?Iâ€™d be interested to get perspectives from anyone in the business, even if you donâ€™t know the answers to all of these questions. I thought about pming some people, but I figured others might want this information as well.**tl;dr: If youâ€™re in the rental industry, answer some questions for me please?****Thanks!**",BabyHandsAtArms,7,25,2,8/31/16 10:21,0.13381722,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

4zkgsj,Legal Advice Needed - Suspended License,1,"So I learned this week that my driver's license has been under a ""SUSPENDED"" condition for over 3 years, and not at all to my knowledge. Some background to this situation may be necessary to understand this unique situation, so here goes:I was last ticketed the very morning I moved here to Charlotte, passing through Alamance County along I-85. I had never driven a certain terrible stretch of highway and failed to notice the signs where it drops down to 55MPH (non-construction zone) and got nabbed for doing 70 in a 55. However, I suppose that in the weeks that followed I got caught up in getting set up in my new place and school starting and everything that I forgot to pay the fine (not the greatest excuse I know, but stuff was crazy those few weeks). I also never received a notification from the DMV saying that my license was suspended, despite setting up a forwarding address with the USPS from my old address to my new one.Now the dilemma; with my license set to expire in a few weeks, do I need to go about requesting a hearing in the county I was originally ticketed in (Alamance) to reinstate my license before renewing it? [Seen Here](http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_20/GS_20-24.1.html) Or, can I simply apply for a new one and not have to worry about my current one being ""suspended""? I am willing to take either route, despite one being vastly more inconvenient; I am just wondering whether or not it is possible to request a ""new"" license instead of ""renewing"" my suspended one.

(The main stage is all the way down by Stonewall.)  â€¢	The streets will be lined by booths from businesses, vendors, and non-profits. Beer and wine are available for purchase after receiving a wrist band from the alcoholic beverage vendor's booth. â€¢	Both stages have a list of the who and what of performers as well as some performers providing entertainment in the VIP tent. (I never get invited there) http://charlottepride.org/entertainment/â€¢	The parade will be held down Tryon and then down Trade Sunday starting at 1:00 it will last approximately two hours depending on how many costumes changes the drag queens insist on.â€¢	 Both Saturday and Sunday night various ""famous"" performers will be performing at extremely crowded local bars and clubs with sky high cover charges. You can PM me if you wish to know what places always reach capacity by 11pm and which are usually a good bet.  â€¢	Lastly is parking, it will be the weekend so lots of metered spaces are free, you can usually find the best spots North of Trade and Tryon such as 7th or 8th streets, I usually have decent luck on Church as well.  â€¢	Good luck, be safe, we're really quite a fun crowd.",Tango_Mike_Foxtrot,3,4,14,8/20/16 6:27,0.092205882,self.Charlotte,5007,Events/Happenings,44

4y1vf0,A few suggestions on driving in a city,1,"Charlotte may not have the traffic problems of Manhattan or LA, but I'm sure everyone will agree there's some terrible driving habits occurring on a daily basis here nonetheless.  Here's a few of my suggestions.  Let me know if there are any I've forgotten:* The left lane is for passing.  If you are driving in the left lane and someone is behind you, move over.  If you are in the left lane to pass someone, but can't muster up the speed to pass them while other cars are behind you, swallow your pride and move over.* Try to keep up with the flow of traffic.  If the speed limit is 55, you are not safer going 40.  You are safer going the same speed as everyone else.* Don't tailgate.  Even if you're stuck behind an asshole hogging the left lane, if he mashes on his brakes guess who's still going to be at fault for the accident.  Tailgating also causes traffic.  If you have to hit your brakes every time the person ahead of you slows down, then the person behind you hits their brakes and so on.  Giving enough space between you and the car ahead of you to coast a little before you have to brake helps keep the flow going. * Use your blinker.  Another useful way to avoid an accident.  Also, be sure to use your blinker well enough in advance for the people behind you to react to it.  If you're already applying your brake by the time you've turned on your blinker, you've turned it on too late.* There is no need to speed through a residential area.  Maybe you don't speed in *your* neighborhood, but be sure to extend the courtesy to other peoples' neighborhoods as well.* Don't blare loud music with your windows down in residential areas.  Nobody wants to know what you're listening to.  Also, I don't know why, but 100% of the time I see people doing this they are listening to something shitty anyway.  There is a time and a place to rock out, and it isn't a residential neighborhood at 2am.* Don't throw your bottles/cans/other trash out of your window.  Not only does it look nasty, but a can thrown out of a window at 65 mph becomes a hazard for everyone else.* If you are pulling onto a road, accelerate quick enough that the cars behind you don't have to hit their brakes.* If you are merging onto the interstate hit the fucking gas!  If you slow down or (god forbid) stop when merging into a road with moving traffic, you are merging wrong.* If you are in the rightmost lane on the highway be prepared to let people merging in.  Unless they have slowed to a crawl or come to a complete stop.  In that case, let them wait so they can think about how they've failed to merge.* Stay in your lane.  Those lines in the road are there for a reason.  Trying to eat a burger, or calling your SO, or posting a fucking tweet are not valid reasons for not paying attention while driving a 4,000 LB machine.* When at a 4 way stop sign, the person who stopped first has the right of way.  If you are that person, don't try waving at the other car to take your turn, just go.* Look both ways at least twice before pulling out into traffic. Trying to eat a burger, or calling your SO, or posting a fucking tweet are not valid reasons for not paying attention while driving a 4,000 LB machine.* When the sun goes down, turn your lights on.  If it is raining hard enough to use your wipers, turn your lights on.  Maybe you can see without them, but that doesn't mean other cars will be able to see you.* Change lanes one at a time.  If you missed your exit, don't swerve across 3 lanes of traffic.  Swallow your pride and turn around at the next exit.  Being late is better than killing yourself or someone else.* Parking.  Don't set up camp with your blinker on waiting for someone to fill their car with groceries and pull out, *especially* if there are other spots available. For one, in the time you spent waiting, you could have parked and walked your lazy butt into the store.  For another, it is inconsiderate to the other people trying to park and for the person whose spot you're waiting for.  I take my sweet time loading my groceries whenever somebody pulls this shit on me.* Be considerate.  Driving doesn't need to be a headache.  The more we take the time to learn and obey the rules of driving etiquette, the better and safer the driving experience will be for all of us.  Happy motoring!",cumstar,5,27,22,8/17/16 5:08,-0.072575645,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

We know that there are rescues and a humane society in town, and we'll look into those options if it comes to it, but we wanted to try and match her up with the right person directly first.http://imgur.com/a/TKygDAbout her:She's a hound dog / beagle mix - skinny and fast with a very loud bark that would be great for treeing a raccoon or scaring off burglars. She loves to run and would make a great partner to someone who is looking for a running buddy.She's nervous around people, and that manifests in to barking like crazy if she sees anyone walking down the street, near the yard, or toward the door. She panics every day when the UPS truck drives by and when the neighbor kids play in the street. Our neighborhood is a new development with about five feet between houses, so she's highly anxious most of the time, inside and outside, day and night. We have tried the thundershirt, hormone spray, and puppy prozac. I think what she really needs is to live in a home with a bit more space between neighbors, and we won't be able to offer that for at least a few more years.She is a bundle of energy and needs room to run on her own or someone who can spend a chunk of time every day exercising with her.She sometimes pees when she's nervous/excited.She is very sweet and affectionate - loves to snuggle and is very patient with our toddler and newborn.We know that this is not ideal, and it would be great if things were lining up better and we were able to keep her. However, after a couple of years of trying and failing to make it work, this is where we're at - and we would rather place her directly into a happy home than have to subject her to shelter life for any length of time. If she sounds like a good match for you or someone you know, please get in touch. I can provide more pictures or more details via private message if you're interested. ",me_white_noise,1,3,1,8/2/16 10:19,0.277945622,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

4vn2ia,Questions about registering my vehicle in North Carolina from out of state.,1,"I know questions like this are asked a lot, but the more people I talk to about the DMV process and registering your vehicle from out of state, the more confused I get...I moved here for a temporary work program two years ago from out of state and will be establishing residency here in Charlotte now. As such, I need to register my vehicle here and change my tags over. I want to get this done as quickly as I can and avoid making multiple trips.So, first question: can I get my North Carolina license (currently have CT ID and tags) and my car registered at the same place? There seems to be a lot of confusion as to whether or not you can get them at the same place. If not, can you at least get your ID and car registered in the same day at the different locations? I reallllllly don't want to make multiple trips if I don't have to. Secondly, do I need to switch my car insurance over to North Carolina prior to getting my license and car registered or do I need to get my car registered/ID first then switch my car insurance to North Carolina? No one seems to know the answer to this, and I can't find the answer to this question on the DMV website. Lastly, what's the deal with the car inspection? I can get that done after I get my tags correct? This whole process is so confusing, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

A friend of mine's husband is a CMPD officer. All officers have averaged about 16hr days this past week. She told me that her husband was told Thursday that no officer will receive overtime for protecting our city during the riots and protests, but that they ""may"" receive comp time. I am so angry right now.  I believe in Black lives matter, and I believe in supporting our police and emergency units. Being pro- one doesn't mean anti- the other. But I can't believe that we are taking such poor care of those who are supposed to protect us. Just needed to vent. I wish the Charlotte Observer would report on this. ",Neyvash,2,17,4,9/27/16 11:00,-0.071845238,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

If I simply abandon it and the state ~~toes~~ **TOWS** it away will they bill me for towing it?I called NC Highway patrol. They said they will flag it and then tow after 24 hours (or sooner if it's deemed a hazard). If I wanted it back I'd have to pay the tow company but the trooper I spoke to did not know if their towing contractors would send me a bill if I never try to get it back. **UPDATE** "" Junk a Car in Charlotte "" offered me $350 and he  is going to pick it up off the side of the road in an hour or so at no cost to me.  By far the best offer I got. More than double what anyone else offered.**UPDATE 2** "" Junk a car in Charlotte"" Dude did **NOT**get the car last night as promised. His tow driver was too late getting back from other pickups so he left a message. Unfortunately not on my phone...he called the wrong number! He left me waiting 2 hours for his call. I eventually called HIM. He apologized,  rescheduled. He SAID he'd pick it up today. Didn't need me there in person but needed me or my spouse on the phone during pickup. Said he'd call today when he was there. No contact. We've been calling him ALL day, no answer. I am displeased. Will update again after I get this situation resolved on way or another. **UPDATE 3** I think this guy is either has a seriously dumbass employee or HE is some sort of fucktard and/or shady dude. He said his employee went out to the vehicle location and tried to contact us, supposedly left multiple messages (complete bullshit, literally did not get even one phone call all day-we are not big phone users and we were specifically WAITING by the phone and checking for calls. Plus, when I asked him to tell me what number I was calling from he transposed some numbers and got it WRONG). I FINALLY got the company on the phone tonight. Talked to a new guy. He relayed above info and said something about them wanting to lower their offer due to an after market catalytic converter being on the car. I don't know that they've even seen the car and I figure this is some sort of standard (shitty) negotiating practice they do and tell him definitively **bullshit** that's an OEM part and it's the original factory part It's never been touched. It's, literally, the part that was on the car at the time of the original purchase. (Note:jaguar does not manufacture this part).....anyway he tells me to talk to the original guy I spoke with...but he's not their until tomorrow AM.  I'm planning on calling tomorrow (Thursday) morning. If he wants to negotiate a little that's cool. I just want to get my dead car off the shoulder of the highway and maybe get a few bucks for it. But I won't tolerate some scammy low-ball bullshit offer, I'd rather call Pull-Apart and have them come get it. (they'd give me just over 1/2 this guys original offer). Or I'll just pull the (fucking expensive$200) battery, tires,  and leather seats, sell 'em myself,  let the state haul the rest away. **PS**- if anybody wants make me an offer on this car PM me. I'm off work tomorrow, I'll sign the (completely clear!) title over.  It can be yours for only **$325 OBO!!! ** Just needs...well, it does need an engine...but other than that it's Fantastic!Thanks all.",LastDitchTryForAName,4,19,18,9/27/16 5:43,0.023863636,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

The idea is quite simple...If you have something NICE and/or POSITIVE to say about a local person place or thing (sure, lets include big box stores, and franchises) that gave you a smile or just plain made life a little less stressful at some point in the last week, show some love! Take a break from the tirade thread, and feel good while doing it! Maybe your good vibes will cause a ripple effect, and send a smile to someone else, or give them the motivation to get up, get out, and enjoy this beautiful thing called life, and do so in our city! This is a win/win situation. Why not take advantage of it?It doesn't have to be about a money saving deal you saw. It doesn't have to be related to financial savings at all, really. In fact, the idea is to stay away from that sort of thing and focus more on the human interaction, and someone else just making you wanna say thank you. Obviously, lets stay away from personal info and full names to keep a little bit of ano-nom-ah-nimity or whatever, LOL!All you ""Negative Nancy's"" and ""Grumpy Cats"" ought to give it a try. It's super simple.  Take a frown, and turn it upside down! Nothin' but love here.I'll get the ball rollin' as an example, and recall my barbershop experience. Use it as a sort of template if you want, or kick it freestyle on your own.SHOUT OUT to the boys at **Matthews Barbershop II** for the most awesome experience, and top notch haircut and beard trim. Taking time to do something right is a trait hard to find these days, in my opinion, and you fellas obviously have pride in what you do.

542clz,I was in Uptown Charlotte last night and I wanted to share my thoughts after reflection.,1,"There is a powerful movement in America right now. It is a movement that revolves around issues of equality and justice, and it takes many forms including Black Lives Matter and LGBQT groups. Whatever your opinion is on recent events, you must recognize that this movement exists, will grow, and needs to be taken seriously. In recognizing that, a person must think about the relationship they will have with such a movement. Are you going to physically participate? Will you lend emotional or vocal support? Are you going to take a position of opposition, and how will you express your dissention? I am not here to tell you what kind of relationship you should have with this movement. I want to share, as simply as I can, my opinion on how to approach this movement â€“ no matter how your involvement manifests.Show Maturity and Respect. At the Charlotte protests last night I was struck by the number of people, of all races, treating the civil unrest as a social event. The demographic last night was predominately young people â€“ my generation and younger. This is the case at many similar gatherings around the country. Before you attend a protest, or similar gathering PLEASE:-Remember you will be filled with adrenaline. There will be a physical reaction in your body that will give you energy. It may make you want to run, fight, laugh, or scream. Be mindful of this before you go. Be mindful of this in the moment. Consider why you are there and act accordingly. -Remember you are representing your cause. Remember the power and prevalence of media. If you are not present to participate in a serious and influential way, in a way that furthers your cause, then go find another place to enjoy yourself. Itâ€™s okay not to participate, it is not okay to goof around and detract from the power that your peers are fighting for. Just look at the pictures and videos from last night â€“ are you seeing the message you were fighting for in the headlines, or are you seeing pictures of broken windows and looted stores?Think Critically. Take a moment before you write, speak, or act and consider your position. Consider your oppositionâ€™s position. Consider your goal. Does your action advance your cause?Engage. Donâ€™t ignore or drown out opposing voices - engage them. Actively listen and respond with thought out arguments. If a person is not showing you that same respect, they are not worth confronting. Request a back-and-forth conversation. Express an interest in their opinion. Make your opposition explain their opinion thoroughlyâ€_that is often the best way to get someone thinking about their position. It can be hard to listen to hate, vitriol, and ignorance â€“ but take those moments to learn about who you are fighting against. Take that time to humanize your opposition because these are the people you need to influence. These ideas may not apply to every situation. There may be times when caution and critical thought are thrown to the wind and a blindly passionate stance is justified. I believe, however, that both sides of this movement need to adjust their relationship with it. Letâ€™s take a step back so that we can actually move forward. No one is going to be happy with the outcome of this movement if it continues as it has been. No one is going to change their mind, and the gaps between us will only widen.  It is time to accept that we can be incredibly different people, even hate one another, and still battle in a way that ends in progressâ€_even if that progress is slow and painful.These thoughts were heavy on my mind after witnessing the protests last night, and seeing the response to it among my peers on social media. If you read this far, I am eager to hear your thoughts â€“ here or privately. Respect â€“ Think â€“ Engage ",PRAISEninJAH,2,24,3,9/23/16 9:20,0.027246181,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

541o0m,Charlotte Trip Update,1,"Hello All!First off I want to begin by saying I hope everyone is staying safe with the current riots that have been going on in Charlotte. I was able to visit for a week from Chicago and just wanted to share my trip since some asked me to share my thoughts after my trip.Me and my girlfriend stayed at a VRBO (like AirBnB) that was across the street from the Charlotte Knights stadium. I have lived in Kansas City, MO and now back in Chicago. Charlotte reminds me most of Kansas City, with is large growth, medium sized city and lots to do. Overall I like Charlotte more than Chicago and KC. Your city is super quiet, I felt very safe all the time, your skyline is beautiful and everyone we met was extremely nice.  **Some Items We Did*** Rented SkiJet on Lake Norman* Lunch Boat Tour on Lake Norman* White Water rafting at US National Whitewater Center* Hiked Crowders Mountain * Nascar Museum We had lunch and dinner downtown a lot, relaxed at Romare Bearden Park and visited the Knights stadium and Panthers Stadium as well.**Positives***just some things we really liked** LOTS to do around the area! Everything in the downtown in a good walking distance* The Knights stadium may be one of the best stadiums for minor league baseball. I love a good city backdrop as well.* Everyone was super nice* Not a ton of homeless around uptown and not a lot of people like street performers (Bucket drums, etc)*Every apartment building seemed brand new, and I could count 5 new complexes straight from my apartment**Negatives*** We noticed in uptown you guys have turn lanes but not a lot of turn signals on the lights, we found this odd* Not a lot of public transportation but I saw the rail line being built from the college and it looked great* No green bike lanes in the city which we found odd because Charlotte seemed to green and active, also you guys have the rent-a-bike system a lot of cities have* We had the misfortune of coming back from Lake Norman during the football game. The police would not let us drive the 20ft to our apartment because it was blocked off, instead we had the pleasure of spending 1.5 hours driving about 6 blocks where the other end of the street was blocked off. We tried speaking to an officer and he laughed and said we should've known about the game even though we were out of towners. It seemed like the police blockage caused more traffic than just lights. I've left blackhawks, whitesox, cubs and bears games and everything gets cleared out much quicker that a panthers game. Even for cubs in wrigleyville with neighborhoods. I felt traffic cleared up quicker once police let the lights do their thing. I am probably wrong though!Overall we LOVED Charlotte and would love to come back. Several friends said they did not picture Charlotte to be as big as it was. It has been a city I have wanted to move to for a long time and was great to finally visit. Enjoy your great city!* [Here are some pictures from our trip](http://imgur.com/a/650NQ)P.S.

I've seen good, bad, and in between, but my soul hurts as I am witnessing the things happening, and reading and hearing the vile things people have been saying.

I'm not trying to use this as a peaceful ""cyber"" protest, because quite frankly I'm not on any side. I just want the madness to stop. My personal experience is in no way on a level that can compare to what's going on right now, but I hope some people can hear this song and take it's meaning to heart.

About 10 times the crowd started running towards 6th ...sometimes those panics were associated with loud bangs or sirens...sometimes they were brief and everyone turned back around quickly. The mood here ebbed and flowed. It was very tense for a while, that's when a trash can was thrown through a window right near me and people reported shootings (no confirmation on that from me). Other times people were laughing and seemingly enjoying the spectacle of it all. It was kind of guy wrenching to see that side of it...it gave me an appreciation for how quickly these situations can get sidetracked from the rightous purpose that was intended. Mostly a young crowd. Some with signs, many well dressed. 80% black and the rest a mingle of other races.  The only tensions seems to be between protesters and police, not race to race.

We deeply apologize if we couldnâ€™t get you a free sample, we learned a lot in our first small batch run. If youâ€™re a fan of the hot sauce, snag an Early Bird Special!&nbsp;**The Trini Pepper Sauce Taste and Background**For those who are not familiar with the hot sauce, itâ€™s called Trini Pepper Sauce, and is a recipe from my family thatâ€™s been passed down from five generations. Every time I took a trip back to Trinidad and Tobago, my grandmother would send hot sauce back with me to share with my friends and family. The hot sauce blends fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs with mustard and vinegar, creating a rich, delicious flavor. The Scotch Bonnet Peppers give the sauce a glowing yellow color. The result is a unique tasting, incredibly flavorful sauce that's so fresh and unprocessed you'll savor each and every ingredient! &nbsp;**To get the sauce**Please visit our Kickstarter page and check out the video and different backing levels.

We've been taking some donations and it looks like we're going to have to rent a box truck due to the generous people in and around Huntersville. I figured since we're already getting a truck, we might as well open this thing up and see what we can do!We are not really accepting food, diapers, etc. that would be addressed by the time October comes around. Instead, we are looking for things that would need to be replaced in homes after they've been cleaned up. Here's a brief list:Gently used furnitureKitchen appliances (toasters, blenders, knife sets, etc.)Larger appliances (we already have a fridge and a freezer!)Clothes, shoes, etc.Winter Coats (especially for kids)TowelsSheets and linensRugs of all typesStuffed animalsBooks of all types (my mother is a librarian and is distributing books to appropriate outlets based on content)ArtAnything else that you think people wouldn't be replacing right away, but would really help people as they put their lives back together.If you have some stuff you've been looking to take to Goodwill, please consider sending it directly to those in need. We are not going through an organization in order to avoid red tape, opting to just bring it directly to families in need and hand them whatever we have out of the back of the truck. Hoever, we will be documenting throughout the trip with pictures and stories. If there is interest, I'll post all of that documentation here so you know it's actually helping people.*I realize I just created this account and this could seem fishy. This is my very first post, but I'm a long time lurker. If we meet to collect any donations I will gladly prove that I am not running a scam here. I still have my LA ID (w/ my BR address) and will give you my direct contact information so you can verify who I am and that I'm actually giving all this stuff directly to people who really need it.Thanks!",LurkerMagoo,1,6,14,9/2/16 5:04,0.093467643,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

59ojtr,Can my job take my raise away after a year?,1,"Hello all,A little over a year ago a Director and VP of my company approached me for a project. The project had me working some pretty crazy shifts, so they offered in that time to give me a bonus in the form of a shift allowance. Before agreeing I negotiated this to be a permanent increase that, I thought I deserved based on my good work, they agreed.A few months later and the project is successfully over, but the raise on my paystubs is still showing as an shift allowance bonus. I inform my direct manager and the director, who in turn says they with contact the VP and HR to get the issue fixed.....This happens multiple times. Unfortunately in the following couple months both the Director and VP involved are no longer with the company.Fast forward to this week...The new director sits me down to inform me that the bonus was set to end after a year and that my next check (which I get tomorrow) would not have the money. I inform him that it was supposed to be a permanent raise and we argue for a bit. I remember the previous director sent me an email stating that he and the previous VP agreed that it would indeed be a permanent increase. I tell the new director and forward him the email, which he tells me is generic. He forwards this on to the new VP who apparently forwards this to HR.I am able to view my paystub for my upcoming check today and the money is gone. I am hoping they tell me they are going to cut me a check for the difference and going forward my check should be fixed, but I have a feeling they are going to tell me to fuck off.In all honesty its not a ton of money...after tax and insurance it only equals a couple hundred bucks per check, but I have kids 1 being autistic and we are a paycheck to paycheck family, so that extra bit of money is groceries.Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thank you!EDIT: After trying to figure out from my boss what is going on with my raise...i was just fired via cellphoneEDIT: Anyone know a good lawyer??? ",Diabetic_Manatee,8,27,13,10/27/16 23:22,0.042239358,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

58o1o6,[NC] Early voting has started! Here's (almost) everything you need to know about it (even if you're not registered!) [xpost /r/northcarolina],1,"**Early voting has started**, and runs most days now through Saturday, November 5th **at 1:00PM**  Everyone can vote early.**If you have moved since you last voted** you need to make sure your registration is up to date.  [You can check your voter registration status here](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/voter_search_public/).  If it's not right, you MUST do early voting so you can update your registration.Every county has at least one early voting location open most days between now and November 5th.  Most populous counties have many locations.  Some locations are open now, some start later.**[Check here for sites and open hours in your county](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/ossite/)**.  You can vote early at **any** early voting location in the county you are registered to vote in.In another post, /u/lurker28205 shared [this map](http://imgur.com/4GZaIqB) with hours and locations.  Also some [more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/58hxll/early_voting_starts_today_week_1_map_and_locations/).**If you are not registered**, you must go to early voting and register when you vote, you will not be able to register and vote on election day.**Nobody needs their voter registration card.**  If you've voted in North Carolina before, you don't need to show ID to vote in person on Election Day or to vote early in person.  However, if youâ€™re voting for the first time in North Carolina, registered to vote by mail, and didnâ€™t provide your driverâ€™s license number or the last 4 digits of your social security number when you registered, be sure to bring ANY of the following: Driverâ€™s license or state ID, US Passport, Employee ID, Student ID, Military ID, Utility bill, bank statement or paycheck.There were reports of long lines at some locations on the very first day of early voting.  I suspect that will not be the case most days, most people should be in and out in 15 minutes.  However, if you can avoid peak times (before and after work), it will help.  Don't let the lines (or fear of lines) deter you, voting is so important!**Who should you vote for?** Well I'm not going to tell you, but it is important to think about who you want to vote for before you go, because you can't really sit in the booth on your phone looking people up (which is technically not allowed).  [You can find your sample ballot here](http://www.ncvoter.org/voting-in-nc/your-ballot/) that has everyone you'll be voting for.  Don't be dismayed by the number of races!  While it's great if you have the time to look up everything, start at the top and work your way down.  One thing you can do is google a newspaper or news site whose opinion you trust and see if they have a voting guide where they talk about who they're endorsing and why.  If you post them in the comments I'll keep a running list here:* [Charlotte Observer](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article109093687.html#navlink=SecList)* [WRAL Voter Guide](http://myballot.wral.com/build.do) thanks to /u/JackTraore* [Raleigh News and Observer](http://apps.newsobserver.com/voter-guide/html/2016/)* [Triangle's Indy Week](http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/battleground-north-carolina-please-dont-screw-this-up/Content?oid=5077240) with endorsements (also has a version you can print and bring with you).**If you're a student** you can choose to register and vote either at your school address or your parent's address, whichever you consider home (but obviously not both).  [More info here](http://campusvoteproject.org/north-carolina/).  You can also register if you'll be turning 18 by election day.**If you prefer to vote from home**, you can request an [Absentee Ballot here](http://www.ncsbe.gov/Portals/0/FilesP/AbsenteeBallotRequestForm.pdf).  The request must be RECEIVED by November 1st.  It may be mailed, faxed, emailed, or delivered in person to your county's Board Of Elections office.  [Find their address here](http://enr.ncsbe.gov/cbesearch/) or see a full list [here](http://enr.ncsbe.gov/cbesearch/PrintableVersion.aspx).  Note that the actual absentee ballot must be mailed by election day, November 8th, and the envelope must be signed by two witnesses or a notary. **Please make a plan** for how and when you're going to vote.  Put it in your calendar and do it!  Make sure your friends and family are doing it, too!**More information** can be found [here](http://www.ncvoter.org/) and [here](http://www.ncvoterguide.org/).If I've missed something, let me know and I'll update this post.",pm_me_your_kindwords,8,19,67,10/22/16 0:11,0.219891928,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics/Voting,1

585sp1,Mooresville or Huntersville?,1,"I'm a New York native currently interviewing for a position in Charlotte, and I've started to take a serious look at apartments in the surrounding area. Since I'd rather not live within the city limits, I've been looking at renting in either Mooresville or Huntersville, and have found two very nice, affordable apartments in both. That being said, I do have some questions about where I should choose to settle down in.The position I'm interviewing for directly involves auto racing, my industry of choice, and I know that the hub of that business is in Mooresville. I also understand that relative to Huntersville, Mooresville has more stuff going on in general. However, the company I'm interviewing with is located right in uptown Charlotte, and I understand that traffic going from Charlotte to Mooresville on I-77 is an absolute disaster (Though I will say that, having driven on both, I-77 isn't nearly as bad as the horror show that are roads in New York's Hudson Valley). As such, I was looking at Huntersville on the basis that my commute might be easier.I currently work an office job in NYC and don't have the luxury of checking for myself, but for my purposes, which town do you think is best for me? The apartments I'm looking at are equally nice and within my price point, so things like traffic/retail/safety are really what my decision boils down to.Thanks.",Tarantula92,2,27,6,10/19/16 3:28,0.132181681,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

I look over at him and he's looking right at me! Then he starts texting, and I think it's a little strange. I've slowed down a ton at this point because he scared the heck outta me. Then he starts (seemingly) recording me on his phone while talking into a little headpiece and moves over so that he's driving behind me then beside me on the other side of my car before he slowly passes me.

I am 28, no kids, will have one pet, and looking to get my first home. My budget is $200k and I don't need a huge house, 1500 sq ft maximum would suit me fine. If I can get it, I would like a decent back yard, good schools around and just a good, safe area for younger professionals. I would also prefer to stay South of Uptown if at all possible.I've been told Cotswold and Elizabeth would be good spots, but I know my budget might be stretched in Elizabeth. I work off N Tryon St, so I would prefer to be within 20 minutes of the city. Pineville wouldn't work for me just because of the commute, although at the moment I work 230-1130pm, so maybe traffic is not all that bad with that schedule, but my schedule could change in the future.Any recommendations are welcome and I am happy to provide more details if I haven't given enough.

56obc2,My Experience with the Trusted Traveler Program / Global Entry Application (TSA Pre-Check) - Charlotte Douglas Airport,1,"I've been telling myself I'd post something like this to give back to the /r/charlotte community ever since my global entry application went through, so here's my experience:**Some Details**To those unfamiliar with the program, global entry is the international version of TSA pre-check, which includes domestic TSA pre-check benefits. It basically means you can leave your shoes on, your laptop in your bag, your toiletries in your suitcase but most importantly you can get access into a super-short security line at the airport for both international and domestic flights (TSA Pre-check is just domestic flights).I travel a pretty minor amount (6 weeks a year for work, maybe 2 weeks a year for personal travel) and have heard about the benefits of TSA Pre-check but have never looked into it. I heard that Global Entry INCLUDES TSA Pre-check but for only $15 more.  (At time of this writing TSA pre-check is $85, Global Entry is $100.) I signed up and finally got it but here's what went down. **What I Didn't Know**: Despite Global Entry INCLUDING TSA pre-check, the difference is that when your Global Entry application is approved, I was completely unable to schedule an appointment with TSA (to basically be fingerprinted and have your identity checked). There are only so many available appointments with the TSA at the airport and there were ZERO available appointments in the next six months. This information was available to me only AFTER I paid a non-refundable $100 global entry application fee. Knowing this was complete BS I called the global entry office at the CLT Douglas Airport. The woman told me to check the website ""up to five times a day"" looking for appointment cancellations. I asked about walk-ins -- she advised me that their office accepts walk-ins Mondays and Fridays only. She also told me to ""be prepared to wait all day"" and ""accept the reality that I may not be seen that day"". Not wanting to take a day off of work, and knowing that was complete BS, I signed up for TSA pre-check (which one can easily get an appointment for several weeks out at MANY locations around Charlotte). **What Ended Up Happening**I was flying back through CLT on an odd Monday so I thought I'd bring my documents with me (passport + proof of residency). It turns out that the walk-in line at around 2pm on a Monday was COMPLETELY EMPTY and I WALKED RIGHT IN. The appointment took about 15 minutes and most of that was two TSA agents BSing with each other about PTO. Gotta love the government. I wanted to share my experience in hopes that it helps someone else. Basically the takeaways are:* If you don't do much international travel, it is way, way, WAY easier and $15 cheaper to just sign up for TSA Pre-Check* If you do a little international travel, and want to take your chances, try the global entry office walk-in around 2pm on a Monday (keep in mind this is a sample size of 1)I hope this helps at least one person out there. Safe travels, /r/charlotte! ",littleweep,2,20,16,10/10/16 5:12,0.096186508,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839
56myxf,Bad experience at Moosehead Grill,1,"Okay, so I don't usually write long-winded reviews like this of local businesses, but this place irked me so much that I felt like I had to, to warn others to beware. Also, let me state that this was late at night, so maybe I'm not being fair to Moosehead Grill. If I went during the day, perhaps it might be better. The way I was treated will keep me far away for some time. Anyway, here we go.Far and away, this is the worst burger joint/bar I've been to in Charlotte. I went there on a Saturday night, so granted, the place was a bit roudy. No problem. The issue started when I tried to order food and a beer. The bartender was busy and I did not see a waitress. I knew they had food, so I got one of the Chef's attention. Right away, I knew this guy was on something, because he didn't seem to acknowledge what I was saying. I began by asking for a recommendation of food, to which he offered a few choices (no menu to speak of), then became frustrated for unknown reasons, asking me several times if I want the tacos or the fajitas. I kept saying 'Fajitas' in vain. He then told me I could eat on the upper deck (a request I had made earlier) and that a waitress would come up. Then, he proceeded to ask if I had any friends joining me. I said: ""Yes, one"", to which he said: ""Is your friend a faggot?"" I didn't know what to say at this point. He also asked me if I was afraid of black people, to which I said ""No, not at all."" After this, he brings me out past the bar, tells me to hold on and shoots down a fireball shot provided by one of the drunks at the bar. Then, he brings me into the kitchen where the chefs are preparing food, and he continues rambling on and asking me bizarre questions, introducing me to some of the guys working who looked inebriated as well. There was a female waiter just standing there as we passed, and when he asked her if she could serve me, she said ""I'm done."" I took this as her shift being up, but I figured out later she was still working. Go figure. So, after asking for the fajitas, the Chef made me a salad (didn't wash his hands) and that was that. No taking down my order or acknowledging that he would make the fajitas. I ended up sitting at one of the booths, eating the salad while the staff walked back and forth, ignoring me as I tried to get their attention and order a beer. I guess if you want to be served here, go and stay at the bar until you get what you need. Otherwise, you're SOL. Perhaps my mistake was going to the chef instead of the bartender. Silly me. Anyway, I swiftly left the place and they will never see my business again for a long time. I'm sure they won't mind. To close, I don't care if it's 4pm or midnight, you do not treat customers like that, and saying ""Oh, it's a dive bar"" is no excuse. Rant over.

Sky's grey, we're expecting a few days of nonstop rain (and likely some flooding in a few areas as a result), and on the bright side, we'll finally get some water.However, that being said? Do **NOT** drive for a few hours once this impending downpour begins. The roads have had a while to accrue oils and muck on them, and without a regular washout to handle it, it has gotten nasty. They'll dislodge, effectively coat the roads in a slick gloss, and put you at risk. Expect wrecks on highways and prominent delays as a direct result. If you have a short commute, you'll likely be fine (especially if you don't have to take any high-traffic routes), but if you're able to work from home or just hang around your workplace for a bit once the downpour starts, that might be a better option than risking it.Update: I get it guys, this is common sense to a lot of folks. I figured it worth bringing up because it gets worse the longer we go without any rainfall, and I've lived here my whole life (sans a 2 year gap about four years ago), and never seen it go this long without a drop.",KamahlFoK,1,46,91,11/29/16 1:23,0.058666667,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

5ej4al,I have to give up my dog,1,"Hey there!I am a 23-year old male living alone in Rock Hill and I adopted a dog from the Humane Society a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, my allergies have become way more significant with my Asthma than I originally estimated and I am looking at having to give her up next week and return her to the Humane Society because of my own health. I have checked with the Humane Society and it's fine if I give her to a different owner, I just have to let them know.I'm her third owner and she is an amazing dog. I would hate for her to be stuck in a kennel again looking for a new home. She is a 2-year old Australian Kelpie (I think there is a little bit of Lab in her). She is around 40 lbs. and stands about knee height. The first owner gave her up because they moved to house that doesn't allow pets and the second gave her up because the dog was too energetic for their full family. She is House-trained and knows basic commands, though has trouble listening when really hyper. She will play fetch, but will play keep away when she comes back with the object. She is very smart though and I have begun clicker training with her already to better cement some things. She has one bite on her record from her last owner, and that was because they tried to shove her off a bed. You'd probably snap too if someone grabbed you when/how you didn't want to be grabbed. She is super sweet and I haven't noticed any aggressive behavior around people (I live in an apartment). I was able to replicate the bite scenario artificially and it is very simple to avoid, so it's nothing to be worried about. I am looking for a home for her. If I can't find one by next week, I will have to return her. I have a dog bed, a food container, scoop, collar, front-clip harness, collar, toys, and treats.  She is a very active dog and I usually take her to a dog park every evening for an hour or two to run around. She is also chipped.If you are looking to adopt a dog, I would be willing to give her up to a loving home and give everything I've bought for her as well. I spent about $400 getting her settled in with everything, the only thing I don't have yet for her are medications (heartworm, fleas, etc.). So you could look at saving a significant amount of money if you adopt from me. I'm not looking to give her to just anyone. I definitely want to make sure she goes to a good home. So if you are interested, please PM me for more info.http://imgur.com/a/l8yaBI checked the sidebar and didn't see any rules against this type of post, but if it is violating any rules, I'm sorry!

We're certain it's because she just lost her best friend, a 13-year old Pitt named Cashious.  On Sunday, Loki started a fight with her. She did not bite her, but pinned her to the ground and pulled her collar, getting her jaw stuck underneath and almost strangling Ladida. It was quite scary and we felt it was best to have Animal Control remove her from our home lest the behavior escalates.I hate to preface this request with that story, but we want to be honest and factual about her situation. With people, she is perfect, and there hasn't been an issue with other dogs until recently. Unfortunately, we received a call from Animal Control to let us know that she would be put down, which we absolutely can not abide. This dog is amazingly sweet and caring. She doesn't deserve that.What we are asking is that if you, or anyone you know, is interested in a larger dog for a single-pet household, to please contact me as soon as humanly possible. Let me know if you have any questions, or write privately if you know of anyone who is interested.  We've tried the Great Dane Rescue and they are full.

I've got minimum until this summer at the school and then I will transfer to a bigger college. (obviously this will help loads in the whole friend making/activities thing)  I live out in waxhaw and i'm still in my parents house which makes social interaction even worse...I'm finding it extremely difficult right now and i'm basically all on my own. I've also just come out of a really serious relationship with a girl in europe (i wont go into detail but we split on good terms because of the distance, shes now seeing someone else and im devastated, everything is up in the air and nothing is certain) and its an exceptionally difficult time for me right now and I'm pretty much reaching out to try and get myself in a better place and to establish a group of friends to keep me preoccupied and give me a more tolerable life here.So, I love belgian beer (i suppose i'm hinting that craft beer might be a thing but i havent tried much yet), partying and getting drunk with friends. I'm very fond of underground raves and techno music. Clubs and commercial electronic music shows are also ok but i'd probably say i'm not a huge fan of a lot of mainstream EDM and all that. I even make some music myself. I suppose i have a bit of a hipster attitude but i'm not into art exhibits or weird social justice activism or any of that nonsense. I've just recently since moving back, got into driving (europe 18 to drive but you pretty much dont need to b/c of awesome public transport), and i dont really know my way around. I hate football and sports bar type things and I detest most of that fratty style stuff. I feel really disconnected because of the cultural differences and ways people do things here. Its not like I can go get wasted and walk the streets bar hopping/going to techno parties with friends and walk home. Also charlotte seems pretty unsafe to me.I just want to get out and do things and make connections with people here but heading into this all alone with no real guidance is pretty difficult, especially in the place/state im at right now.So if you can give me any advice, tips, places to go, things to try or if you want to reach out to me I would be eternally grateful. :)",atoastedcucumber,2,9,2,11/17/16 8:43,0.102203463,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

These databases could not be loaded properly to record the voting data.  - Due to the error, over 90,000 votes we hand counted.    - Before those 90,000 votes were counted and submitted, McCrory had a lead of 60,000 votes.  After, he was trailing by 2,500 votes.    - The North Carolina Republican Party has filed a formal complaint asking for a hand-recount in Durham County.   - The county board voted (2-1 in favor of) to have a hearing on Friday to determine if a recount should happen.       **Additional Information:**  - According to state law, if the difference in total votes is less than 10,000 once all counties are confirmed, either candidate may ask for a complete recount.  - If that happens, a recount will not likely occur until after Thanksgiving according to multiple news reports.      If I made any mistakes please let me know and I will make edits as necessary.

Home of the [largest selection](http://flightclt.com/beers-on-tap/) of any of our normal cycle, Flight gives the opportunity to try beers not only from the greater Charlotte area, but also into the mountains, the Research Triangle, and beyond. Tuesday is also Flight's 22oz night, getting you a 22oz beer for the price of a 16oz, and free beer is always a reason to be happy! To go with the great beer and to prevent anyone from having too much to drink on an empty stomach, Flight has my [favorite menu](http://flightclt.com/menu/) on our meetup cycle. So come on out on Tuesday for great (somewhat free) beer, great food, and great company! Hope to see you all there!",Baelzabub,93,19,6,11/14/16 21:43,0.411029412,self.Charlotte,5007,Meetup,137

We have a 4,000 sq ft house that we bought 10 years ago that has 2 apartments in the basement. It is about 1/4 mile from the light rail line at UCB. My mom lived in one of them and my brother-in-law lived in the other, but both of them passed away. I promise, the house is not haunted! We have gutted one of the apartments in order to remodel it, but neither my husband or I have the time or cash to go down there and fix it up. This one is a studio (it did have a bedroom, but we removed all the walls to make it a studio). The other side is a one bedroom that is partially finished. Both sides have private bathrooms and connections for kitchens, but no kitchens installed.I had an idea that maybe we could find someone who would be willing to fix up the apartments in exchange for living there for free. We could negotiate the terms to be good for you and for us. I was thinking something like a year of rent free living in exchange for remodeling the apartments. You would have to pay for supplies, but you won't be paying rent, so I think this is fair. The ideal person would have to be very flexible, as we have 4 kids that are loud and ridiculous. I would have a serious problem living with someone who I didn't trust around my kids. We also have 4 dogs and 3 cats, but they stay completely in the upstairs part of the house. Basically, the house is a blank slate that we would really like to fix up, we are just too busy to do it. Let me know if you are interested in something like this.

I'm usually pretty good at planning dates (or so I'm told) but this one was a bit tougher - my date is under 21. So for Friday, the kind of ""focal point"" of the date was the Bobby Lee stand up show at The Comedy Zone. The show has been canceled, so now I'm looking at finding another under-21 friendly thing to do. I've got a couple little things we're doing that let us talk, of course, but I like to find something fun that's a little more outside the norm (at least for my date).Some ideas I had but can't seem to find specifics on are:1. Live music in a setting where we can talk, like a coffee shop or low-key 18+ bar. Something low key and fairly intimate, not like a concert type deal. Are Tin Roof and The Evening Muse (and anything similar in uptown/NoDa/Plaza Midwood) 18+ before it gets late? What other such places are there?2. Cool local happenings. Think art show, or a local flavor type event.

Me and my girlfriend moved up to Charlotte early this year and were there for about 2 months. We ended up coming back down to Florida after a combination of family and personal issues. During our time there we really didn't get out and see much. Since we both work from home making friends was pretty tough, and we also didn't get out in the city at all. The close proximity to hiking and the mountains was a huge plus, though.Anyway, once our lease on this place is up we're thinking of moving back. Florida really doesn't have much to offer us and we miss the weather and landscape so much. However, we're a bit both cautious that we might not meet people or branch out at all. Do you have any recommendations as to what we could do to meet some like-minded people our age? Has anyone else moved pretty far away to Charlotte and made it okay?I have a friend in Raleigh, but it's almost twice as far away from the mountains as Charlotte is (honestly a pretty big deal, haha).",syntaxhighlighting,1,7,2,11/2/16 12:07,0.128835979,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

5kyl0g,Hi! Local doctor recommendations please!,1,"Earlier this year, I acquired health insurance for the first time in years! I made the plunge and set up an appointment with a doctor that had good reviews and a recommendation from someone from another thread.Though I have a few things that I would like to work on, I would like to primarily focus on my ADHD. I was prescribed Vyvanse in my early 20's (I'm 28 now) and was lucky enough to have it for several months before losing my insurance. It was a night/day difference on how it helped me function.I've had a desk job for the past 2 years and it's driving me bananas. I've learned a lot of great coping mechanisms through the years that help combat my attention problems and social anxiety but just because I'm 'doing rather well' doesn't mean it's not a struggle. Being productive and organized keeps me in good spirits.I mentioned how my desk job has caused some increased difficulties with my ADHD and how my previous prescription to Vyvanse helped with these types of difficulties in the past to my new doctor. While she seemed understanding, she only felt comfortable recommending me to a psychiatrist to get re-diagnosed with ADHD. (And to talk about my depression, anxiety, weirdness')I'm only a month into a four month wait for the one she deemed appropriate (and that is just for the first appointment, which may add even more time to my timeline); I'm trying to be patient but with this past week being a terror at work, I'm making this thread. Without Vyvanse or anything to help with the difficulties caused by my ADHD, I often get distracted and have trouble staying on task for the things I need to do and that cuts into my productivity/organization/happiness/self-esteem.So, I'm looking for recommendations on a doctor - one who will basically prescribe me Vyvanse (or similar) without having to go through a psychological exam.Thank you so much.",JessTheGardener,3,2,3,12/30/16 3:11,0.133441558,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839
5kyc7z,New Family in Charlotte looking for advice,1,"Hey everyone. My name is Michael. My family and I are moving to Charlotte from Hampton Roads (Virginia Beach, VA) late March 2017. I'm actually already here because of a job I accepted with a company called Compass Group (2400 Yorkmont Road), and I got temporary room and board in the area so I can save money to move my family out here without any issues. From what I've seen in the month I've been here, I'm loving Charlotte already.My question is : What are some great areas to move to for a family? My family and I (husband, wife and 1 son who is 5 years old) are the ""outdoors"" type and we like to go to the park/playgrounds/bike or walking paths/etc. on the weekend and get fresh air. We've also heard Charlotte has an excellent public school system. We're really looking to rent a house or an apartment at this point. Should I consider looking into Fort Mill or Pinesville? Ideally, I'd like to stay somewhere in South or Southwest Charlotte and be close to my job, but I'm flexible if it's worth it. I really know very little about Charlotte and moved here by upstanding comments from family and friends.Any help or advice is much appreciated. Hopefully I've been descriptive enough with our needs. We're going to start using Zillow to search for affordable housing starting the beginning of February. Thanks",Michael_S1987,3,55,12,12/30/16 2:29,0.250367647,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

5jau4g,How do you find out if there are warrants for someone?,1,"My brother has always been a bit of a flake (read: troublemaker, repeat offender, general pain in the ass, but he's my brother and I love him). Well, It's been about a month now, and no one's heard from him. My parents passed away last year (both within a month of each other), and all of the family members my brother kept in contact with haven't heard from him. He is technically homeless (I believe, he go goes back and forth from shelters and living with people), living in Shelby. He is also on parole. I am trying to figure out the best way to find him/get in contact with him. My fiancee tried calling the parole office, they straight up refused to talk to her, before they even got any information. I feel like that is a dead end. I checked all the local counties recent arrests, he isn't one of them. I checked and made sure he hasn't been re-incarcerated. If he was in violation of his parole (hadn't checked in) there would be an arrest warrant out for him. This is one of the things I am trying to check, and I can't seem to find any resources to do this.My last option may be to file a missing persons report, but I feel like I shouldn't have to do that, if someone from the parole office would just talk to us. What should I do? We would like to see him for Christmas, and more importantly, we want to know he is okay.Edit: Thank you everyone. We found him. Some of the state websites I had previously checked were not up to date. Apparently he violated parole. Thanks again for everyone's help and suggestions.

5iibo3,We just got ambushed in the General Assembly - here's what's happening (Sen. Jeff Jackson),1,"Here's what's happening:This week we were called into a special, emergency session to address the needs of those suffering in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.  We passed a disaster relief bill and were adjourned.Then - unexpectedly - we were immediately called into a second special session with no clear agenda. I can assure you that no one in my party saw it coming. It was a complete surprise.They said all bills for this new session - which had no parameters - had to be filed by 7pm.  By 6pm there was still nothing.  In the next hour they filed over two dozen bills affecting all types of issues.  Lots of these bills are over 40 pages long and have clearly been in the works for weeks if not months.One of them strips power from incoming Governor-elect Roy Cooper in a number of ways: makes his cabinet appointments subject to General Assembly approval, dramatically reduces the number of employees that report to him (they now report to the General Assembly), and more.  They basically stripped as much power as they felt they constitutionally could.Nothing is law yet - we're still in session and will start voting this afternoon.  The bill about limiting Roy Cooper's powers is likely to pass, but it's unclear how many of the other bills have support from leadership.We have no filibuster and they have the votes to pass any of them.  And Gov. McCrory almost certainly won't veto anything.  So what can you do?  One big answer: Get ready for 2017.  A federal court has ordered that we redraw our districts because they were racially gerrymandered.  That means that all of your 17 legislators in Meck will have to stand for re-election, and that they'll all be in new districts.  Some of those districts will be newly competitive.  A pick-up of a handful of seats in the state House or Senate would allow us to sustain Gov. Cooper's veto, and that changes the entire political landscape.Until then, feel free to be in touch with me anytime at Jacksonforncsenate@gmail.com.Regardless of your political party, you deserve leadership that respects you enough not to govern by ambush and circumvent the outcomes of elections. Right now, you don't have that.As I type, I can hear protesters inside the building chanting.  I hope we can channel this into a real get-out-the-vote effort in 2017, or I have to keep giving you depressing updates like this, instead of reporting on action that would actually make you proud of your state government. I think we can get there.",JeffJacksonNC,25,592,3156,12/16/16 0:08,0.115638528,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

5i6qfd,"Do you think you can help me find this guy, r/charlotte?",1,"Hello great people of Charlotte! Below is a true story. It's christmas time and I started to wonder what ever happened to this guy. I want to know if he ever made it home and reunited with his father. Sadly, I can't remember his name, I just know he's from Charlotte, NC. I'm from Europe and English is not my first language so bare with me. November 11th, 2015. 3AM at Miami airport/Greyhound bus station. I didn't have a credit card to buy the tickets online, so I had to buy them from the station. I arrived 9 hours early. Spent my last 120 bucks on New Orleans bus tickets. Had about 70 cents to buy food for the next 30 hours. I'm already hungry as hell. I see a bag of chips on the bench outside. They're not mine, but I'm going to eat them. I sit down and see another figure sitting in the dark on the other side of the bench. Something tells me they're his. I sit down and wait, just in case. I notice he's keeping an eye on them too. Half a hour passes in silence. Finally I stand up. ""These yours?"" I point at the chips. ""Nah, thought they were yours."" Well what the fuck, let's split it then. I victoriously open the bag and we feast on the bench. He says he's from Charlotte, North Carolina. Great guy, really humble. He had a big argument with his father, hopped on the bus in the heat of the moment and ended up in Miami 30 hours later. Now he regrets it and wants to go back home. I tell him I'm sure his father really loves him, no matter what. Kinda like me, he has an empty stomach and no money left. We spend the next couple of hours talking about life, wandering around the airport and transit center. Finally, early in the morning it's time for me to get on the bus. First stop, Orlando, 5 hours away, happens to be on the route to North Carolina also. I know I can't leave him here, so I'm trying to figure out a way to get him on the bus. But he doesn't have a ticket and we don't have single dollar.We get in the line to board the bus. There's a super strict conductor outside, checking every ticket closely before letting a person enter. She acts like she has the most important job ever. I tell him to go behind the bus and wait for my mark. Finally, it's my turn. I walk up to the lady with my duffle and pretend to be looking for my ticket. I make a scene like a girl on puberty. I empty out the bag, throwing my shorts and shirts in the air. ""I can't find my ticket, I know I put it in the bag!"" In the middle of my tantrum I see him run behind the conductor into the bus. Mission accomplished. I smile, I put my stuff back in the duffle and take my ticket out of my back pocket. I'll never forget the conductors face when I gave her the ticket. She checks it and I get on the bus.I sit in the back of the bus. A fist appears from behind me. ""Thanks."" No problem haha. I dap him and we both fall asleep. I see him one last time in Orlando when we exit the bus. I just have this one selfie of us lol. I hadn't slept for like 35 hours. He's the guy on the right.:http://imgur.com/a/bLdapI know this is kind of random, but I thought it's worth a try!

I've been looking pretty hard for a month or so, and I'm going to get desperate if I don't find something by Mid-January. I don't know the Charlotte area very well, but I work out of Matthews and my SO works in between Huntersville/Mooresville. Right now we live off of Margaret Wallace, so it only takes me about 10 minutes to get to work, but the SO has to leave at 6:30 to get into work on time in the morning (takes her anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half), and takes her over an hour to get home. Yeah, I know, Charlotte traffic sucks, but I'm looking for something that's going to be more in-between Matthews and Huntersville. I don't mind driving to work in the morning, as my hours are very flexible and I can work from home as well. The reason I'm asking for help is that I don't know Charlotte that well. Matthews is nice, haven't had any problems at all down here, but I'd like to move to north half of Charlotte. I put in an offer for a house near the Whitewater center the other day, but there were 19 total offers on the house (It was only on the market for THREE DAYS!) and I didn't get it. My budget is 175k, so that throws the really nice areas out of the picture.

They require 60 days notice but I only gave them 30, meaning that I'll be financially responsible for the additional 30 days unless a new tenant is found by my move-out date of January 11th. The apartment just went on the market but since it's in my best interest to find someone asap I thought I'd post here to see if there were any interest. My lease terms would transfer to the new person - it would be a 13 month lease with a base rent of $784.

5r23d5,Camper for a good cause?,1,"Hiya r/charlotte!Hoping one of you might be able to help me ( or you know someone who can help me).  I'll try to keep this brief.I have a very dear friend who has a debilitating disease.  I don't want to share her private information publicly, but she is in her early 30's and has declined so rapidly that she has been forced to pick between a lifetime of being cared for by others or a drug that could give her more time being mostly upwardly mobile, but also could kill her at pretty much any moment.  She has decided on the latter, and wants to make sure that she really LIVES.So, I want to help my friend really live, and we are working on planning an epic roadtrip.  She wants to see things she's never seen and go places she's always wanted to go, and I want to help her do that.  Because her income is limited ( she's currently on disability), I am happily footing the bill.  So that she can experience as much as possible, I'm trying to keep certain costs low so we can spend money in other areas.  We are going to camp our way through the roadtrip, but she really cannot tent camp due to her physical restrictions.This is where I am looking for help.  Pop-up and pull behind campers are available for rent, but are pretty costly and cut into our ability to pay for other parts of the trip pretty significantly.  I have a vehicle that can tow, and so I'm wondering if anyone here might have a camper that I could privately rent for 1-2 weeks this summer.  I don't want something for nothing- I can pay what you think it would be worth... I just can't afford the $100 a day that rental agencies charge.  I would also be happy to purchase supplemental insurance, provide a driving record, criminal background check or anything else that would help someone feel comfortable with renting us their camper.  We are flexible with the timing, but sometime between Memorial Day and Labor Day is our target.I'm happy to give more information privately, but if it helps any, I'm a 39 year old mom, a homeowner, a girl scout troop leader.  I'm really just looking for a bit of help in making this happen for my very dear and very deserving friend, and I am hoping one of you might be able to help us out.Thanks so much for your time.",papillon24,4,5,56,1/31/17 1:19,0.19406573,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

My job would be in Ayrsley, she'd be in medical. I did a bunch of reading on here for actual amenities / neighborhoods / etc, but I mostly wanted to see if there are any PacNWers here, and just get a sense of the attitude of the city, etc. I'm pretty used to Seattle, which is a very modern, fresh, energetic, fairly liberal city; I've never been to Charlotte, or NC. I have a friend who lives there, and she said it's a surprisingly young city with the banks and medical communities. Thoughts? Also, general thoughts on whether you'd move into Charlotte from out of the area if you had a choice? We're both pretty open to where we end up, just want to work in a job that we both enjoy. For me, this is a good opportunity, and she'd do well as well.

Since I moved into my place in May 2016 my bill was somewhere between $13 and $15 a month. My last bill was $37 and change, and this new bill was $70 and change. The gas is connected to the range and the hot water heater. Both my electric bill and water bill were the same as usual, if not lower than normal. I wasn't even home for three weeks during the stretch of both bills. I called the company and they ran the numbers for the property and it showed a spike in cost during this time of the year for the previous residents as well. They are sending someone out to check the line and meter, but I'm guessing they won't find anything. Has this happened to anyone else? It just doesn't seem to make much sense since all living habits are the same. EDIT: Solved: Gas line is connected to the hot water heater. Hot water heater is connected to the heat pump.

I've lived here nearly a decade and have never heard this area called ""Prosperity Village"" prior to Google's labeling. Highland Creek's rollout happened first and was to the north/northeast of this area. I'm fairly sure the Google installers have been working east-to-west as they ran cable, and by that measure suspect I'm at the furthest terminal ass-end of the Prosperity Village range. (If I'm not, then I can see the end from here.)Yesterday a nice contractor came out to wonder about the feasibility of digging around numerous exposed tree roots while avoiding existing buried cables and such. Today a fellow with a Ditch Witch laid the cable through my yard and affixed the box to the side of my house. Next up should be a contact from the inside installer, and hopefully not long after that I'll be able to visit Speedtest for a lovely four-figure result. Of course, that assumes that ""guy running cable to my house"" is one of the last steps to occur; I don't know that the conduit has made it all the way through our neighborhood yet. I've seen S&N trucks out there for what feels like years and there's still a big ol' conduit loop being installed within half a mile of me. Maybe Google's just trying to get their contractors to move ahead of AT&T? Their reps were handing out Gigapower notices today (digging to commence in two weeks -- though if they stay on Google's schedule, AT&T would finish their work sometime in 2020).

So, I need some advice on how Charter Schools work and are there other areas with better schools? They also will be considering the Ballantyne area. I just recently moved here myself so I'm not familiar with all the areas and especially the schools. I know there are a lot of nice houses in Huntersville, and Cornelius ect... so I can't imagine the people living in the mansions on Lake Norman would be sending their kids to a 4 rating high school, so I'm just curious what they do.

5n11jm,"No school for CMS students Tuesday, January 10",1,"Due to the severe weather, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will be closed for students on Tuesday, Jan. 10. Students will not report to school. All CMS staff will report to work at 11 a.m.    For schools on the traditional calendar, the make-up day for students will be Friday, Feb. 20. The student make-up day for Project L.I.F.T. Continuous Learning Schools Walter G. Byers and Bruns Academy will be Friday, March 17. Druid Hills and Thomasboro academies will not make up the student day because they already have 19 additional days built into their calendar.    While many roadways and CMS campuses are clear, weather reports indicate there may be black ice and refreezing, which could cause roads to be unsafe during the early morning. Despite day-long efforts to remove ice from parking lots and walkways at school campuses in all nine learning communities, there is still significant amounts of dangerous ice in many areas. Five tons of ice melt have been used thus far and 750 pounds will be spread tonight and tomorrow. Approximately, 50 school campuses continue to have limited access due to the ice. The goal is to provide safe access for staff by 11 a.m. Tuesday.    Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.",CharMeckSchools,9,17,9,1/10/17 6:55,0.039126984,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839
5n0tsi,PSA: Please attempt to get the ice off your cars before hitting the roads.,1,"I may be out of line for not waiting to post this tomorrow in the tirade thread, but I feel like it needs to be said because I noticed a LOT of cars on 85 between China Grove and Belmont with this problem... Residual ice flying off the hoods and roofs.PLEASE, don't just scrape enough ice off your windshield that you can see through it good enough to drive . What you THINK is snow sitting on top of your car has turned into a pretty solid sheet of ice, and as soon as the air catches it while your running 55+ it becomes a pretty serious risk to other drivers as it goes flying through the air. The larger pieces that don't break apart in the air can do some damage. Not to mention the drivers who freak out and start swerving like crazy trying to avoid it, and risk causing even more problems or accidents. Or striking pedestrians for Christ's sake... I spent 10 minutes cleaning off my car yesterday, after letting it sit throughout the snow, and entire next day. Where I park is pretty shady, so there was no real chance of anything melting in the sun. But, 10 minutes.... that's all it took. 10 minutes is very much worth avoiding the risk of causing a melee on 85. Scrape the glass entirely. On the hood and trunk if you lightly tap your fist, it will break up the ice into smaller little chunks that will slide off easily with a little help. Same goes for the roof. It's not going to dent you car unless your trying to full on punch it like you're training for the next UFC event.Also, do NOT use hot water. You'll crack the fuck out of your glass. Hell, don't use water at all. And make sure your wipers aren't frozen into an ice block on the cowl of your car. If they are, DIG THEM OUT. You will NEED wipers. And lastly, for future reference... Cardboard or towels are great for covering your windshield and preventing the ice scrape headache. So, think about that next time we have snow in the forecast, or a freeze warning with any precipitation expected. When you park your car at home after grabbing your bread and milk, just cover up the front and rear windshield if its gonna be exposed to the elements.I'm really not trying to be an ass. I just don't want to hear a news report about a family in a minivan being killed on their way to Disney World because some person's car let go of a huge chunk of ice.

Also someone who could be a ""mentor"" to me for poses or ""looks"". This is selfish in the sense that frankly I have been feeling pretty down about myself looks wise and I just want some reassurance or even get a shot at submitting headshots as a last ditch effort for me to feel better about myself (as I'm typing this it all just sounds so stupid and whiny but again I don't care and this is just how I feel so take it as you will). I don't really have any money but I'm pretty professional and I could buy you a drink or two after shoots or before or whatever. If you need to know what I look like please PM me and I can send a few photos as we can go from there. Thanks and I'm sorry for sounding so..petty and stupid.

Of course there are some weather concerns for this weekend with possible snow so these plans are weather dependent, I will try to update around noon on Saturday about the meetup still being on. Hopefully the weather permits and we can have a great Saturday to start off this new year!

5woyco,Advice for (re)starting a photography business in Charlotte,1,"Hey everyone,Just recently moved to Charlotte about 3 months ago after I accepting a job with a big company. My wife and son had to stay behind in VA while I save up money and get acquainted with the area, but they will be coming down shortly. In the interim while I wait for my family, I'm wondering if anyone would have some advice on how to get my wife's photography business started. Before we came down to the VA/NC area, we were living in Chicago for about 5 years when she started her business. Using Craigslist as her primary source of advertisements, she was able to maintain a fairly consistent volume of business, especially during the spring/summer. By the end of our stay in Chicago, she was doing so much business that she had to turn people down. She worked primarily as a professional wedding photographer.Fast-forward to today, her business has basically died and we can't seem to find a way to resurrect it. Her charges have been affordable and she has fluctuated her prices to try to see if it makes a difference. We've been posting on Craigslist in the Charlotte area with minimal responses. I'm wondering if anyone has some advice or information about the market, even from a consumer perspective (what websites to search for photographers, what are the best venues, etc.). My wife is talented and enjoys her work. Here is a link to some of her work : https://www.facebook.com/StylersStudioAny help or advice is appreciated.

The cherry trees were in bloom when he died and it is a little way we can include him in our family pictures by using the trees as a backdrop. Unfortunately, the early bloom this season means I can not find a location that still has cherry trees in bloom. I called UNCC Botanical Gardens today and they said their cherry trees are done, the office park near us has already finished blooming, etc. I didn't call Daniel Stowe due to the cost prohibitive $250 location fee on top of our photographer's sitting fee. So, I am turning to Reddit to see if anyone knows of any cherry trees in bloom this Sunday anywhere in the CLT region. Thank you so much for any help.

If anyone is a therapist that would like to help create one or at least start me on the right path, I would be overly ecstatic about collaborating with you.I have been in 2 long term abusive relationships, one of which is current, and I just really need someone to talk to that shares my experience.  I've been to individual therapy and it just told me everything I already knew in the back of my head and it may seem easy to just say, ""Just end it,"" but it's not always an easy case.My goal is to create a community of support and allow those that may be struggling with abuse or the after effects of abuse to share their story and feel connected to others so that they don't feel alone in their struggle.  I also want to be very cautious with how it's handled as well, I don't want to start a group and have the community lead itself down a path that it shouldn't or give bad advice.So, once again, if anyone is interested, knows of a group already in progress, or is a professional that would like to help create one for the area, I would enjoy the help.Thanks",AbuseSupport,1,12,10,2/15/17 23:51,0.096447468,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

I hung on to the coupon since I knew I needed an inspection and went over on my day off. It was a tiny little place, one garage with an attached waiting room. Guy at the station was real friendly, said I could keep my coupon because they were doing a grand opening spring promotion. I go to the waiting room and watch him work. Cool set up, they've got multiple cameras and monitors so the one guy can look all around the car at once. I was out in probably 10 minutes for a grand total of $25. Cheapest and fastest inspection I'd ever done.Now two weeks later my wife needs an inspection. I lost the coupon and can't remember for the life of me exactly where the place was or what it was called. I'm sure it was on South Blvd, I want to say near either Tyvola or Park Road.

Who knows, I miraculously met my best friend in my last city through Reddit and we are incredibly close so maybe lightening strikes twice? I'm not new to the city but after a year and a half of efforts I've decided to just go ahead and put everything out there. I'm 26(f), married, and work in travelling sales. I like generally nerdy things - Harry Potter, books (always), marathoning Netflix, and hanging out with my dog. I dig fitness type stuff like hiking, although I would in no way describe my self as fit, I just enjoying getting out with the dog. I like adventures and collect magnets from each new city that I visit. I'm not a heavy drinker and don't live downtown, which is why I've avoided the brewery scene for the most part so far. I am 420 friendly but that's not really something I like to base friendships on, kind of the ties that bind but not the main tether. While I appreciate any suggestions you may have for how to meet people, that's not really why I'm posting. I'm kind of just looking for a group of like minded chick friends here with similar interests. I, very naively, looked for any options of friendship when I first moved here, leading mostly to men and it turns out people are not as kind or respectful as I thought or had hoped. So I think I really am looking for other ladies unless you, a male, come with an awesome wife who also wants a friend.  If any of this sounds like you or you have found yourself in the same boat, please feel free to message me! Even, and especially, if you just want to geek out about Fantastic Beasts or any new book you've found. =]",firewhiskyepiskey,1,17,11,3/31/17 2:52,0.230647727,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

I've been doing some research and thankfully various NC sites have put together DIY divorce kits that have helped me understand the process tremendously. After having done said research, it still seems pretty daunting and would rather out-source this to someone who is knowledgeable and would show up in court in my behalf.So, what I'm asking is, are you or do you know of a lawyer who has dealt with really easy divorces before? No troubles or property to split. Just need to get it finally legally done. Please let me know if you can help! Edit: I've decided to go with John Walker, who seems to have it very streamlined and efficient. His packet was easy to understand, I'm able to afford it and I like that everything is done over email/mail. Thank you everyone for your recommendations and stories. Even though divorce seems very lonely at times, there are many out there who know exactly what you are going through. Please don't hesitate to reach out when you need it!

All other plans for the site have fallen through and it remains essentially a parking lot.I don't have kids. But I do have a vested interest in education. We all do. We need to make sure we have an economically and culturally flourishing society for the years to come. I have major, major problems with the direction of education over the last 100 years.We have and continue to raise kids to learn four subjects (Math, English, Science and sometimes History). We say this is what time you show up. This is what you wear. Listen to your teacher/boss. We raise generation after generation of worker bees and lament the lack of creativity. Of course we're not a creative society -- we have stifled it out of the most creative individuals in our society -- the children!We start asking kids at 5 years old, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" This is a one dimensional question. No wonder no one can answer it even as adults. There are a very few people who grow up knowing they want to be a firefighter. Most of us stumble through school, college and our careers looking for something that instills passion.We do not expose children to enough subjects. If we teach personal finance, aren't we teaching math with it? If we teach how to build a bicycle, don't they need to learn physics and pi? How can we continue to over-test, over-work and stress out these great, budding minds and not take the time to shepherd them to find an inner passion? How can we possibly train children for a work force when we don't have any idea what that work force will look like in 5 years, let alone 20?Steve Jobs dropped out of college, yet remained on campus wandering from class to class and just looked for subjects that interested him. One of those subjects was calligraphy. Hardly a useful skill. Until you're building a personal computer and decide that you're going to invent fonts.The next generations won't be excelling in singular fields. They'll be marrying AI with cooking. Robotics with surgery. Instead of teaching four subjects, we need to teach 400. Learn how to cook, how credit works, entrepreneurship. Teach dance, painting, civics. Find and instill a passion for learning no matter what the subjects are.We don't need an education evolution. We need an education REVOLUTION.So I'd like to propose (to anyone that listens) that Charlotte develops this Eastland Mall location to be a world-class education campus. Funded by private means because, once again, we all have a vested interest in the next generation.-We need to stop gating our adult education behind community colleges and universities. We should offer adult education and vocational training 52 weeks of the year. It should be 100% free and not time-gated by semester. We should offer classes on personal finance, English and Spanish as a second language, cooking and parenting while also training plumbers and mechanics. Come and take classes when you can.-We should use a severely under utilized asset as teachers -- senior citizens. We have millions of them in this country willing to volunteer and they have something to teach us all. Seniors need to pass on the education and PASSION they have. We will shuttle them onto campus or beam them in through Skype.-We should have a research center whose only mission is to find, cultivate and implement any tool that will make education easier and more effective.-A K-12 public school on campus that believes in thinking outside the box and restores emphasis developing individual passion in order to instill a lifelong thirst for more knowledge.To reiterate, any class you want to teach and we'll find a room for you to teach in. Any class you want to take will be 100% free and you're welcome anytime. All lessons get posted online for free viewing. We will teach you and your child in the same class. We will offer child care for babies and toddlers while parents are in class. We will educate work skills as well as life skills. Your children will go to school and be exposed to enough subjects that we will find their talents. Teachers will become shepherds of passion.We will, in short, create a better society. How could anyone be opposed to this?Wait, was this supposed to be 140 characters?",Jesse3581,3,6,1,3/22/17 2:20,0.133909091,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

Plain and simple, he's a working dog. Unfortunately because life, I don't have the time to work with him how I used to. Because of this, he's suffering in my opinion. He's anxious, and hiss lack of ""work"" is driving him nuts. I'm not sure what to do with him, honestly. My heart doesn't want to rehome him but realistically it's the best option. I travel once / twice a month for a week at a time. My wife doesn't have the same bond with the dog so that's not much of an option to pawn him off that way. So here's the deal, if someone is interested in a dog, I'd be willing to have a conversation and meet up. Please understand you would be getting a high drive dog that needs work. He's not for the inexperienced, which is what I was when I bought him. He needs land to roam, someone to spend time and work with him and he eats 4 cups of food a day when sedentary. I spend upwards of $90/mo on food for this guy. He's healthy, neutered and knows/obeys all the basics. No bite work, no tracking work. Very social with other animals, been boarded many times with no issues. Send a message if interested. ",KoreaClippers,14,27,33,3/5/17 22:49,0.140702381,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

We return at around 12:30am and unlock the deadbolt but the doorknob wont open. [this kind](http://casaveneracion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/front-door.jpg). We do not have a key to the side door so we are officially locked out. I call the ""emergency"" maintenance line about 20 times leaving 2 voicemails, as well as called the company itself. No answer. So I called a locksmith and he came and got in the side door for us. This is when I found out the doorknob is just flat out broken. It will open the door from the inside but won't budge at all on the outside. So I get charged $192.50 for the locksmith. Sunday night (44 hours later) the emergency maintenance guy calls me and says ""Are you still locked out?"" He was sick all weekend and forgot his phone in his car. So anyway, the maintenance guys come on tuesday and wind up putting an entire new door knob on the door because ours was so old they couldn't find the parts to fix it. They also give us 2 keys to the side door.Now, the property manager is telling us we will only get reimbursed partially for the locksmith, if at all,  and since we called after hours they would've charged us anyway. (why? I don't know. But they shouldn't charge me for something that they failed to do in the first place.) Also she told us that it was ""on the tenant to maintain the property."" So am I officially out $192? How can I fight this? I could understand if we locked ourselves out, but we didn't, it was failure of the doorknob which is part of the house we RENT.

Because three of them are hitting the age of mandatory retirement soon and Gov. Cooper would be allowed to appoint their replacements.That's it. That's the whole reason.There was abundant evidence presented to the legislature that the Court of Appeals has a heavy workload and this bill will slow down the disposition of justice in our state, but the bill was quickly passed despite these warnings.Notably, the last four Chief Justices of our state Supreme Court Justices - a bipartisan group - all strongly opposed the effort.Here's the most remarkable part: The move was so extreme that it compelled one of our judges on the Court of Appeals who was approaching mandatory retirement - and is a conservative Republican - to resign his seat in protest of the law and thereby allow Gov. Cooper to appoint a replacement.As he said, â€œI did not want my legacy to be the elimination of a seat and the impairment of a court that I have served on.""Gov. Cooper vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden by the GOP supermajorities that currently exist in both chambers. It's now law.********Here are some articles and editorials for reference:News & Observer: http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article146974404.htmlU.S. News: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-carolina/articles/2017-04-26/n-carolina-lawmakers-halfway-to-veto-override-on-court-sizeSlate: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/04/24/north_carolina_republican_judge_resigns_in_protest_of_his_own_party_s_attack.html",JeffJacksonNC,25,59,201,4/29/17 0:15,0.181150794,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics,60

67dm1k,"20-something city gal looking for a new start, will I find it in Charlotte?",1,"Hi r/charlotte! I don't post on reddit often, but i'm a pretty big lurker and have been searching for an answer to my specific dilemma here with no certain answer. I'm 23, and from Philadelphia, PA. I grew up in the 'burbs here and graduated from college this time last year. I moved to the city to be more successful in school and in my social life, and I still feel like it isn't everything I anticipated. A few years into living here, I realize that I'm not really headed down any particular career path, though I've always been into music (a lot of psych/rock/indie/electronic stuff to put it vaguely), drawing and writing.  Philly's not great as far as paid job opportunities go, so after school I got into nannying, which has been good for a creative type like me - something to just pay the rent and not a depressing office job.Fast forward to now: a year after graduating school, me realizing that I can't really keep up this lifestyle forever - working, paying the rent, taking small trips here and there but not really giving myself room to grow in finding a career, building relationships outside of the world I know or setting long-term goals in general. I have the opportunity to move to a Charlotte suburb with my family later this summer, but I'm hesitant to commit to it fully because I don't know what I'd actually be doing there. I know I want to get out of my element and make new friends. Philly often feels small to me and at concerts, parties and other events I always feel like I know most of the people there (in a claustrophobic kind of way).  I'm worried that I'll have trouble finding likeminded people in Charlotte, even though I realize there are a lot of transplants like me. I'm not big on religion, sports, or drinking. I know that there is at least some kind of art and music scene in Charlotte, which is a big draw for me, but I have no idea what the nature of it really is or how to get involved. Here, art and music are a pretty big deal but I feel a little bit stagnant having gone to the same venues and scenes for a few years. I plan on staying in Charlotte for a while and feeling it out, but I'd like some pointers on what kind of art/music clubs and communities are most open to newcomers. Here, most of the people my age hang out at house shows or in bar-type venues where a lot of varied music acts come through. Where's most like that in Charlotte? In Philly there's a facebook group for just about every community - people who put on diy music shows, art folks, lgbt groups, women who bike, mom groups (comes in handy because I'm a nanny), philly photographers, and all kinds of groups for specific neighborhoods. Are there specific groups like that for Charlotte? Or maybe just one general group besides reddit that I could start to get a more personal feel for an online community? I'd like to work as a volunteer, work part-time as a nanny and potentially work another part-time job where I'd be likely to meet creative and easygoing people like myself. Is there a neighborhood that would be good to look for jobs in? I'd like to do something like work at a vintage clothing shop, or a book/ record store. Just somewhere semi-creative that I'd feel more driven to connect with people than to get a huge paycheck.  Where would be a good place to start looking for a job like that?A huge part of why I'd like to move is for cheap rent to live with family, because of the weather and green-ness of the environment â€” there's not a lot of that around here except for some short months in the spring and summer. I love the possibility of taking day trips to Asheville, so yeah, the nature stuff is really appealing to me and to some extent the potential to isolate myself from a bunch of noise/other people if I want or need it.  I also have a dog, and I know that he'll be a lot happier to have more green space. But I'm not totally sure where to go from there with helping myself grow. Sorry if any of this seems stupidly naive. I'm like 75% decided that I'm going to move, but I know I still have a lot of research to do. Help a gal out?TL;DR: 23 yr old Philly native feeling stagnant, moving to Charlotte. Looking for ways to become involved with the art/music/creative scene and to get a feel for the community in and around Charlotte so that I'm not clueless when I get there. ",strawbaeri,1,47,11,4/25/17 9:53,0.12902066,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

Interestingly, the land company in Charlotte lists Tricon as the property owner since 2015.So, my disabled mother has no water service in her apartment, the only person that can connect the water is the new property manager, the new property manager is a shell company with no phone number or person to contact.What do.",MxrRR,1,18,20,4/25/17 4:49,0.087605377,self.Charlotte,5007,Charity/Assistance,14

65f72o,"Dear Charlotte drivers, you suck at driving today (unusually so, on top of sucking most the time). Could you please stop sucking for this weekend, as you already ruined my day off on Friday.",1,"Dear Charlotte Drivers,You suck at driving. That comes at no surprise to an outside observer, but I realize your self-righteous self is incapable of self reflection and doesn't get the correct feedback on your horrible driving as much as drivers up north do. Mainly, due to the fact, that most drivers around here are too scared, or too much of a pussy, to use their horn and give you feedback you deserve oh so much. Up North, the horn has taught idiot drivers that they are, in fact, in the wrong.Some observations today on the road:* -Watched someone come to a DEAD STOP on the interstate to allow another MORON who doesn't understand that you are supposed to hit the accelerator when merging onto the interstate. No, driver who stopped on the highway, you are not being ""polite"" to the idiot who can't merge, you are being an asshole and risking the lives of others on the road because of your behavior by coming to a dead stop on the highway (where the speed-limit is 65+mph in that location). Also, NO, you were not in the right. You were in the wrong and will eventually possibly learn that when an 18-wheeler comes plowing through your car and kills you, because NO they can't stop like a car.Also, to the driver who can't merge onto the interstate, revoke your license (actually, both of you revoke your licenses). If you are incapable of properly merging onto an interstate, you have no business driving on one.* -I'm sure the one of the drivers above caused this, but thanks for helping cause an 18-wheeler to turn over and block ALL lanes of traffic on interstate 85. You turned a normally 30-minute drive into an hour and a half drive. Yes, I was in the wrong for not having my google maps on (to avoid the stupid accidents you cause 24/7 on the roads around here) because I assumed you idiots would take a day off from being stupid on the road. I was clearly wrong. * -Thanks for the rest of your stupidity. To the point that the passenger in the car, who is not originally from Charlotte (but does live here now), made the observation that you all are horrible drivers compared to other places.* -The only drivers who seem to trump you at sucking at driving are the cars with ""South Carolina"" plates in Charlotte. Sincerely, stay on your side of the border (at least with your cars, take an uber or something). We have enough bad drivers around in Charlotte, we don't need further support. You take it to a whole next level of poor driving. Also, you all are the few people on Earth who manage to CONSISTENTLY, go 10+ mph UNDER to speed limit.Anyways, just a concerned citizen letting Charlotte drivers know (and SC drivers in the area), you SUCK at driving and seem to not realize that. Again, this is a futile letter as the majority of you all are sincerely incapable of self-reflection and think all the above behavior is normal and everyone else is wrong to call you all out on it. But, no, it's not normal behavior.If you all are dead set on getting into a car crash, then please do so on a dirt road away from others. Total your car and don't buy a new one and get off the road please. Stop putting the rest of our lives at risk because you are incapable of learning how to drive and learning how to self-reflect that YOU may be in the wrong in how you drive.Sincerely,A concerned citizen who thinks you suck at driving and you need to GTFO the road.**EDIT: Feel free to downvote all you want. You can click a downvote button, but you can't downvote the truth. The letter is staying up. This is dangerous behavior and I'm calling it out for what it is.****EDIT 2: This link proves my point: https://www.charlotteagenda.com/44380/bad-charlotte-drivers-really/ .**>Waze actually listed Charlotte as one of the 10 cities were drivers were MOST satisfied. Their ranking was based on traffic, safety and the self-reported â€œmoodsâ€ù of Waze users.>Charlotte came in at No. 20 with a death rate of 9.8 for every 100,000 residents. Just ahead of New Orleans and significantly ahead of Atlanta. New York City was the safest by this measure (no surprise) followed by San Francisco.**Basically, my point was made with this article. Charlotte driver's are idiots. AKA, they are in great moods while driving (aka, oblivious to how stupid they drive). Yet, they rank as horrible drivers in real life (along with other southern cities, who are also horrible drivers).****This proves my point.****EDIT 4: Top controversial post on here right now. AKA, a lot of people upvoting and downvoting. AKA, a lot of people agreeing with my post and a lot of a-hole drivers who are mad they are getting called out and refuse to self reflect. Drop your ego and fix your driving, your putting other people's lives at risk with your poor driving.**",charlotteaccount,19,61,20,4/15/17 5:01,-0.122028544,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

Am I correct in believing this?For my story, I need some sort of forest and a hiding place, because someone kidnaps a girl and hides her away. Just to be clear, this is fiction. I am not going to kidnap anyone.There's a place called Silverwood. My question is this: Can someone hide around this area and not be found by police?Also, is it very far from the city itself?I'm sorry if this is inappropriate.My second question is this: What is Charlotte like? Are the people friendly? Helpful? Is it calm, or a stressful city?I watched some videos on Youtube, and got the impression that the city was nice and tidy. Also very pretty, and I liked that. My own country doesn't have any big cities that fit what I needed for my story, that's why I decided to use Charlotte.If there's anything you'd like to tell me about the city or surrounding area, please do.

Help?",1,"So, I have noticed that in the USA (and especially in Charlotte), most apartments are built out of wood/sticks. This, is cheap building material, and in many other countries they don't build with this material because it sucks.

I'm looking for a solidly built apartment, made of concrete, that makes it near impossible to hear my neighbor.What apartments exist like this in Charlotte? I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe every apartment is wood based.Seriously, I need an alternative because I have lived in apartments for 3-4+ years in Charlotte and EVERY neighbor eventually ends up sucking. At this point, I have given up on my hopes of humanity, where people act respectable to each other, and would rather concrete deal with others inconsiderate behavior.Can someone please provide me a good list for this?Thanks for any help.PS: No, I don't want to buy a house. I don't necessarily know yet if I will be living in Charlotte in the long term and don't want to get locked down with a house right now. **EDIT:** See I am being downvoted.

I'm super excited; it looks REALLY nice. Thank you all again.**Hi all, I'm a girl and I live in a shitty neighborhood in east Charlotte. I moved here a few months ago (for my job, without knowing the area, unfortunately) from the safest neighborhood in the universe where I used to love to go jogging/running outside every night. That's not an option at all here (for reasons ranging from ""constant traffic/no sidewalk"" to ""creeping dudes, domestic disputes and drug use everywhere"") and it's slowly driving me insane. After a really uncomfortable encounter with one of the other residents here when I tried to go for a quick walk the other day, I decided I was done and needed to find an indoor track (also useful for when it rains since it seems to rain A LOT here). Unfortunately from googling it looks like there aren't any nearby except for the Albemarle YMCA, which closes before I get home from work and change clothes, the baptist church on WT Harris, which only lets church members pay to use their track (I asked, you can't just pay dues, you have to take a class with their pastor, publicly announce your faith in front of the congregation, agree to their ""church philosophies,"" etc. I'm a gay-as-fuck atheist, I just need somewhere to run), and the Jewish Community Center (word's still out on whether or not non-Jewish people can get membership for their gym facilities; it's been a couple of days and I haven't heard back from them). Is anyone else aware of any indoor tracks that don't close until around 9:30 or 10? If not, are there any other girls here in east Charlotte (not uptown, you know, the more outskirty parts) who go running at night, and if so, where??? I love running outside if possible but it seems like the parks all close at sundown too. If I have to I'll get a gym membership somewhere with treadmills, but it's REALLY not the same as actual running. :( It's making me super depressed not having a safe nearby place to run, since again I like to go every day and am not looking for an hour+ round trip (can't pay that gas bill, yo).

Should I take Independence or Monroe? Any other thoughts or suggestions? Experiences? I'm not really freaked out, but it is slightly worrying me.Update if anyone cares: I arrived with plenty of time to spare. The lounge area while you're waiting to be called to a courtroom is pretty nice. There are TVs and they showed a morning movie (didn't catch the title, as was mostly on reddit on my phone) and an afternoon movie which was Total Recall and they made popcorn for everyone. There are vending machines, outlets for your devices which you're encouraged to bring, even laptops and shit. There is a quiet room, a locker room, a business room with desktop computers you can use, and upstairs there are friggin' arcade games and a pool table!

By doing so my deductible doubled, my coverage was cut to a third of what it used to be,  there's no glass coverage (all SC comprehensive covers all glass on your car with no deductible), cost increased from 130$ a month to 157$ and North Carolina doesn't allow you to use Uninsured Motorist coverage on a hit and run.On Monday I was hit by a short ghetto woman (based on clothes and her spray painted car) who stopped, looked in my window while I was just waking up after being knocked out and then drove away. The cops came and said they would look for the woman but it's on me.  Now I have to pay 1000$ deductible to have my car fixed even though it wasn't my fault.  I don't know if this will raise my rates or not because Geico won't give that information when you call them (at least that is what I was told when I called this morning).I can probably fix the damage myself for about 600$ but still this is bull shit. My 19 year old brother was hit by a drunk driver who twisted my brothers truck and sent my brothers head through the back window and injured his back.  The driver ran away from the seen leaving his car and his girlfriend.  The guys insurance refused to pay my brother and the hospital sent him to collections ruining his credit.  Nothing happened to the guy for over year after the finally went to serve a warrant after multiple calls a day for the past 6 months where he was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and nothing else.These two expedience make me think the right thing to do is you're at fault is to just leave.  The lady that hit me will probably never get caught and the guy that hit me won't even have a traffic record.  But my brothers credit is ruined and Im out $500-$600.

So they are selectively choosing which covenants to enforce, and which houses to send violations to and which not to. I'm the only board member voting to enforce this. But a lot of homeowners say they DO want it enforced.I've asked the board to use part of our legal fund to hire a lawyer to have any covenants amended that people want changed/removed, but they ignored my request.The HOA President is now trying to gather support from the community to remove me from the board (I'm 95% sure they won't get enough votes, I'm the only 1 on the board that seems to do anything). HOA President emailed me today and said ""The HOA is not a business, it's a community"" That should be proof she isn't handling her fiduciary duty to follow the covenants, because the HOA actually is a registered non-profit corporation.Is the board able to pick and choose which covenants they enforce? Should I hire a lawyer and sue the board to make them enforce everything as written?I started a petition today to remove our HOA President and I've gone door to door collecting signatures, our bylaws say we need 51% vote to remove a board member.I know most people here probably hate HOA's...so just don't buy a house in 1. But don't join one and then break all of the rules.",Squanchy5,3,26,1,5/4/17 10:52,0.1034375,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839
694vvk,Seeking another lawyer to add to my roster.... Preferably a blood thirsty one.,1,"I already have 4 lawyers for each particular nuance of the below issues and the individuals involved... I'm looking specifically to end the careers of the city officials responsible for making me hide in my closet and check all 5 of my new security cameras every time my door bell rings out of fear of being hauled off in the middle of the night, AGAIN, because we have retards that can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality in positions of power. And force the city to invest in even the most basic of automated background checks, and give their magistrates and judges the same Bullshit-o-meter training they give to our police officers, as they didn't believe any of their stories. But which is apparently so thorough, that they won't even take a physical evidence of a death threat against me seriously, because it's embedded in a 2000 character psychotic rant from arson suspect #2 that they don't want to deal with it, and assume shes the mother of my child or an ex lover that I'm seeking vengeance on.Twice these past 24 months, I've born witness to Charlotte magistrates and judges acting like 7 year old children, with a complete love of fairy tales, believing stories fabricated with absolutely ZERO evidence and exercising ZERO critical thinking skills. The results of this has been my 8 month old daughter being snatched to the other side of the country for a week and fucking hospitalized (I had to fly to Utah and form a sheriffs posse to retrieve her..... and it took 2 months for her to fully recover..), just hours before being evicted from my home with no one to care for all 3 of my pets.Fast forward several months, not 2 days after another hearing for custody, which was given to me again..My then 2 year old German Shepard/puppy and two cats are murdered in still open Arson investigation, because she was given un-supervised visitation(because kidnapping and filing false police reports isn't enough to warrant supervised visitation with her aunt in a quarter million dollar home down the street ....)So I had to transport her and my daughter 30 minutes away to stay in a 1 bedroom apartment shared by 3 adults and now a baby, and on my way back from dropping them off 30 minutes away, I get a phone call from the second arson suspect that my ex-wife set my house on fire before we left, and murdered all of my animals...And then a year later, I'm arrested while home alone while changing my now 2 year old daughter because the second Arson suspect (who sat in my driveway for 45 minutes while my house was on fire, after locking her cats and their litter box in her room and locking their cat door, and instructing some 8 year old neighbor's child to call 911 while she held her phone in her hand, and ran inside for half a second to inhale some smoke... A person with an active restraining orders against them, and who isn't allowed to see their children without court appointed supervision.. ) made MULTIPLE and finally a successful attempt at convincing one of the aforementioned retards, that I stole the medication for her mental illness over a year ago, because I refused to commit insurance fraud, and tell my insurance company that I was renting her a furnished room, and her past two attempts at suing me to replace her stuff were considered Nuisance claims.Fewer comments the better, I want to think about this as little as possible...PM me with the contact info of any blood thirsty lawyers.",CharlotteEngineer,1,4,1,5/4/17 10:17,0.001954643,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

In the â€œdesirableâ€ù school district, the average sales price was $622,173, with homes selling in 52 days. In bordering â€œnon-desirableâ€ù school district, the homes went for $292,023, with an average of 62 days on the market.This is a massive spread of course but they also broke down something more specific:> Around Scaleybark Road, the Agenda found that a home sold last summer on Castlewood Road for $440,000, or $271 per square foot. A few months later, a similar home on the other side of the dividing line sold for $299,000 â€” just $158 per square foot.Even if you split the difference here that's $56.5 per square foot.  On a 2000 sf home that's $113,000 which is crazy.  Imagine being put upside down on your home due to a decision by the school board.

One bouncer told a very large bouncer to let me in and when I tried the other told me to leave. So I did but then tried to walk back to tell my friend what was going on as they had told me to call whoever I was with. The large (3x my size) bouncer then cam charging at me like a football player, at which point I began to run but not to get inside just to get away from this very dangerous man. the last thing I remember is being put into a choke hold before I woke up in the hospital. My friend saw it go down and says their were FOUR bouncers holding me on the ground. I find this to be extremely excessive and I will need help paying for my ambulance ride and stay in the hospital.

Someone creates a boogeyman with a lie and then presents themselves as the only person standing between the people and this supposed danger. Ignoring withdrawn consent to sex is clearly illegal under North Carolina's Kidnapping and Sexual Battery laws at the very least.  Some attorneys say that it is covered under rape statutes as well.  Yet Senator Jeff Jackson is peddling the lie that ""a woman cannot revoke consent to have sex"" under current NC law to promote himself and his legislation.This is extremely dangerous for women in NC and around the country because people might believe this lie and ignore a woman's withdrawn consent.  Furthermore, women might be even less likely to report a sexual assault because they think that it is not illegal based on what this guy is saying.  Please spread the word that a woman **does** have the right to revoke consent and that it is highly illegal under North Carolina's **current** kidnapping and sexual battery laws to ignore revoked consent.Here is a direct link to the statutes:http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_14/Article_10.pdfhttp://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-27.33.pdfEDIT:  The senator is now back-peddling slightly and has admitted that misdemeanors apply (http://archive.is/VZcKJ), however there is still a long way to go before the damage is undone.

6j530a,North Carolina is the only state in the country where a woman cannot revoke consent to have sex. I'm trying to fix that. (Sen. Jeff Jackson),1,"Session is about to end for the year, but there's something important I'm still working on and I'm hopeful we can get it done before we adjourn.North Carolina is the only state in the country where a woman cannot revoke consent to have sex once sex has begun. Sounds nuts, but it's true. It's from a 1979 court case called State vs. Way.That means if a woman initially consents and sex turns violent, she has no legal right to tell the man to stop and he cannot be prosecuted for rape - even if he admits that she had clearly withdrawn her consent.That means that a woman can say 'no' - but she can't say 'stop.' And that's clearly awful.Cases have been dismissed (or charges not brought) because of this court case, including at least one in Mecklenburg. There are some cases cited in the articles below, and I personally encountered this indefensible loophole when I was a criminal prosecutor. Fixing this has been on my to-do list since joining the state Senate.I filed a bill fixing this last session and had several Republican co-sponsors. It went nowhere. I filed it again this year and - again - it's gone nowhere.In my conversations with legislators, I haven't heard anyone who believes that women should not be allowed to withdraw consent. As a member of the minority party, it can be difficult to find out why some bills move and others don't.I'm still working on this. The reaction from the press in the last week has been very helpful in shining a spotlight on this glaring defect in our rape law. If and when this bill is allowed to come to a vote, I expect it will pass unanimously. Hopefully we can get it done this year, but if we can't, I'll try again next year. This really should be a non-partisan no-brainer.*****************Reference:North Carolina Legal Loophole Prevents Women From Withdrawing Consent to Sex http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/north-carolina-legal-loophole-says-women-can-t-withdraw-consent-n776026â€˜NC is the only state where no doesnâ€™t mean noâ€™: Law says women canâ€™t back out of sex http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article157694194.htmlOur View: â€˜Noâ€™ should really mean â€˜noâ€™ http://www.fayobserver.com/opinion/20170622/our-view-no-should-really-mean-noIn North Carolina, No Is Not Always No, If The Sex Has Already Started http://www.npr.org/2017/06/23/533947926/in-north-carolina-no-is-not-always-no-if-the-sex-has-already-started",JeffJacksonNC,25,106,249,6/24/17 8:10,-0.082886905,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics,60

We're getting rather fed up with Seattle and my wife quickly rejected my suggestion of looking at Texas and suggested Charlotte. A little background on us. We're both in our mid 20s, just had our first kid, I have an MBA from University of Washington and she has a Bachelors degree from there as well. I work in digital advertisement and make a fairly good living. She is a business analyst for an insurance company and makes ok money as well. While I say we live in Seattle we actually are about 25min north of the main city. Both of us have lived in WA since moving to the States (me 20+ years her 10+). We own a house and live pretty comfortably. Both of our parents live 10min North and South of us. I'm mostly Armenian and part Russian and she is 100% Russian. We've fully assimilated to US culture but still respect our background.We're Libertarian. I am a huge advocate for the Second Amendment, respect the Constitution, hate Communism and am fine with the legalization of weed (I prefer alcohol but to each their own). While WA and Seattle used to be fairly balanced with Left and Right wing nut jobs, its becoming too far left for my liking. More and more legislation is passing that I don't agree with and there is constant threat of diminishing my passion (shooting). The massive influx of Californians is only making it worse. It's very quickly becoming a place I don't want to raise a family in. We do love the PNW outdoors. We love to go hiking and camping together. I spend most of my weekend mornings fishing or going out to a shooting pit.My questions for Charlotte (or very close neighboring suburbs).-How do you like it?-What's the balance of political preference? I don't mind people of different opinion, I just don't like being the black sheep and having to constantly listen to my office berate my leanings.-How is the job market in Charlotte? Particularly around advertising or tech product management.-What's the NC firearm laws like? Concealed Carry? SBRs/Suppressors?-That said, hows the firearm community? I am fairly active on a popular gun forum here and have met some great people through it.-How are the public schools? -What areas around Charlotte are best avoided?-How are the outdoor activities? Hiking, fishing, camping? I also hate snakes and know there are some venomous species around there.

I even attempted to get my parents to let me put a tiny house in their backyard, but that isn't going to happen (I'm late 20s though, just fyi).I'm just at a loss. I'm tired from the lack of sleep caused by these people. I am probably just going to pay the two months rent to break the lease because I am too tired to fight with my apartment to fix this.Can someone help me out? Is there a good company to go through to rent affordable houses? Does anyone have any other suggestions?I am at a loss. Any advice or help? I would really appreciate any help.**PS:** Also, if the recommendation is to move into a different house/townhome, I would prefer it not be privately owned. I prefer renting through a company or ""official business"" because there rules seem more formal and they don't inspect you every month/harass you.

6ifyht,Calling All Home Brewers - AIGA Charlotte presents their Fourth Annual Beer & Branding event â€“ 1st place beer will also be released as part of NoDa Brewery's popular NoDable Series! (x-post from r/ncbeer),1,"http://charlotte.aiga.org/event/beer-branding-kickoff-2017/In collaboration with NoDa Brewing Company and BOLTGROUP, AIGA Charlotte presents the Fourth Annual Beer & Branding for summer 2017. At this unique two-part event, local designers work with local home brewers to ideate, brew, and design a branding package based on a secret brewing ingredient. This all starts with our event Kickoff (Thursday, July 13th), and culminates in a brewing competition and a design showcase where attendees will select their favorite branding packages.**Since the Kickoff serves as the first official meeting for designers and brewers, attendance is mandatory for participation.** From there, the objective is to inspire the local beer and design community with a united naming, branding package, and beer product, all while keeping in mind the following aspects: the beer style, the top secret ingredient, the local culture, and the community.Both the Kickoff and Showcase will be held at the NoDa North End location on 2921 N. Tryon Street. Also, both designers and brewers must register through the AIGA Charlotte website to ensure that one designer (or team) is paired with one brewer. **Registration will be cut off one week before the Kickoff, on July 6th.** Once registration is full, weâ€™ll start a waiting list in the event that any designers or brewers drop out. At the Kickoff, no walk-in entrants will be accepted.**If youâ€™re a designer:** First register for the Kickoff event. You can participate individually, as duos to form one team, or as an agency. If youâ€™re a duo or an agency, at least one member of your team must be present at the Kickoff event. At the Showcase, attendees will vote for their favorite branding packages, with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place â€œCrowd Favoritesâ€ù being announced. All final branding packages will be featured on the AIGA Charlotte website.**If youâ€™re a brewer:** First register for the Kickoff event, and then mark your calendar since attendance is mandatory for participation. Beers will be judged by a select panel of beer experts before the Showcase. At the Showcase, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place beers will be announced, and the 1st place beer will also be released as part of the brewery's popular NoDable Series.",aigacharlotte,2,2,15,6/21/17 2:28,0.091666667,self.Charlotte,5007,Events/Happenings,44

My son is socially delayed and has trouble ""engaging"" with other kids. I take him to the park/playground to play with other kids every week,  sometimes twice when I can, and the poor guy just has so much difficulty communicating and socializing without being ""awkward"". It's been this way for a while. He was problematic and disruptive in preschool too and the teacher suggested I look into some sort of behavioral therapy for him. All that being said, he's a good kid with a great heart and I do my best to affirm that. He will be starting kindergarten this year and my fear is he will be eaten alive by the other kids and become discouraged. When I was living in Virginia, I've had him tested and he is not autistic. I'd like to find some ""social skills"" therapy program in the Charlotte area, but am not sure where to even begin to look. I will be meeting with the guidance counselor in our school system to ask about options, but I wanted to start here first. Any help and recommendations are greatly appreciated! I know with the right direction, he'll turn out fine! Thanks!",Michael_S1987,3,4,5,6/19/17 10:42,0.1307505,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

This week, we're heading back over to [Legion Brewing](http://legionbrewing.com/), Plaza Midwood's favorite brewery. Probably most recognized for their Juicy Jay IPA, Legion has demonstrated a major talent for every style they put their minds towards. Currently [on tap](http://legionbrewing.com/pages/on-tap-at-legion/) there is a great selection of typical summer styles with IPAs, wheats, and weissbiers. For those of you who prefer their beer a bit darker, they have a robust porter on tap and I have been thoroughly impressed with every dark beer I've had at Legion. For food, Legion has [a kitchen](http://legionbrewing.com/roots/) with some pretty good food (definitely try the boiled peanuts if you like those)!

You can buy a Wooden Robot growler, and they swap it out for a new one when you come in for a fill, but they won't touch a growler from a different brewery (also you can't buy WR growlers anymore).  I ended up getting two Crowlers since I had already made the trip, but it's kinda defeating the purpose of the growler, no?  I have three growlers that I can't take to the breweries now.

6qt0kx,Federal Court: New NC legislative maps must be drawn by Sept. 1st,1,"A few hours ago, a federal court ordered that new NC legislative maps must be enacted by the General Assembly by Sept. 1st. We finished our regular session for the year earlier this month, so that means we will have to go back into a special session to get it done. There will be no special election - despite the court's previous order to have one - for lack of time. This is frustrating because it means the GOP has been rewarded for dragging its feet, but new maps were - by far - the top priority, and we got that. After the new maps are drawn (by the GOP), the court will then review the maps to ensure compliance with its ruling on racial gerrymandering. The fact that the court has already said it is going to review the maps before they can take effect is crucial. The court has said that if the GOP-drawn map doesn't meet its standards, it will appoint a ""special master"" to draw the map - which would be the worst case scenario for the GOP, in light of how heavily they rely on partisan gerrymandering to maintain control (just as my party did, incidentally). That should scare them into at least attempting a good faith effort, but hey who knows.At a minimum, these new maps it should significantly increase the number of competitive districts across the state. That's good.Ultimately, of course, we absolutely need independent redistricting. Politicians cannot be trusted to draw their own districts. In the meantime, this is progress.Happy to answer any questions.Here's the full court ruling, if you're into that kind of thing: https://www.dropbox.com/s/euby0jyr08o72r2/Order%20on%20Redistricting.pdf?dl=0",JeffJacksonNC,25,20,100,8/1/17 9:29,0.135145231,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics,60

(I'm not posting this under my usual handle, as I don't want my weight listed on it.) I'm going to share my and my husband's personal weight details and maybe that'll help some folks with their decision on going or avoiding certain Walk of Shame potential rides. (For the record, we're both changing our lifestyles and have lost quite a bit of weight this year before anyone says anything.)Me: female, 5'6, 250, I carry most of my weight in my thighs and torso.Husband: male, 5'8 240, his weight is more evenly distributed, no big gut, large thighs. He had no real problems with any rides. A few were snug, but everything clicked/buckled.Intimidator: I barely got the two clicks. The seat belt was plenty long enough and I was squished like hell in the seat. My husband had to push down the lap bar (or whatever it's called) to get my two clicks. A woman who appeared to be about 15 pounds heavier than me had to leave the ride, so I was cutting it super close.This was the toughest for me. I was going to skip it because I didn't get two clicks on the test seat, BUT I walked through the line with my husband and kid anyway and thought I'd try a back row seat. It did fit a bit better and I got the clicks. Afterburn: It was also a bit snug (but not as much as the Intimidator). I sat on Row 6, which had seats that have double belts and are supposed to have slightly larger seats. No problem with the harness or buckles. Cobra - I saw in the last row on this, too. I was comfortable and had no issues. Nighthawk - I skipped this because I don't like it, but husband rode with no problem. Cyclone - Also no issues. Rapids - No issues. Woodstock Express - I rode in a seat by myself. Had no issues with this other than leg space, but since I was by myself, that was fine. Boo Blasters - All fine. Do-Si-Do - All fine.Pants vs. Zombies - Not very comfortable since my butt was on the back ridge of the seat, but no real issues. Rock 'N Roller - Fine.Scrambler - Fine.Aerial chase - My husband rode this with my son. Said it was snug but the harness went down. Peanuts Pirates - No problem. I didn't get to try several things, unfortunately, because the rain closed everything (and we only had twilight tickets, so were there for about 4.5 hours). But I hope this info will help anyone who searches for this or has any concerns about fitting. Edit: All of the operators were very nice and helpful when I asked about any ""Big Boy"" seat.

6nhgwa,Dirt Bikes and ATVs in Neighborhood Late at Night and Police Seem Disinterested - Anything Legal to be Done?,1,"I moved to Charlotte a few months ago and live in a pretty tightly packed neighborhood with lots of homes close together on small lots (lots of renters as well, my family included). Pretty much since we've moved in we've seen and heard the same dirt bike and atv riding around the neighborhood with teenagers or younger on it, usually during the day and every now again at midnight or later on all days of the week. Their riding includes riding wheelies down the road, burning out on the back tire of the bike, and otherwise generally making a ton of noise. During one of 12:30am Tuesday night occurrences I reached out to the non-emergency police line, and after asking us some questions about if the riders were disrupting traffic or committing any other crimes they stated ""we'll see if we can get an officer available to come through the neighborhood."" I've called twice since then (once daytime once night) and gotten a similarly disinterested response. Other neighbors have also mentioned calling without any change to the rider's habits. Is there any way to address this other than continuing to call? During the day the engine noise is obnoxious, but when it jolts you out of sleep in the middle of the night it's infuriating. Some neighbors and friends I've discussed this with have joked about backing out in front of them or leaving nails on the road but I'm not interested in potentially seriously injuring them (they're just kids being punks). That said, it's driving a lot of the neighborhood crazy. For reference, this is a neighborhood between 85/485/77 north of uptown. It's not the best neighborhood but it's far from the ghetto and composed of mostly families. ",proto04,1,13,6,7/16/17 2:25,-0.006707284,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

As such, this Saturday we're going to be starting the next phase of the meetup, the greater Charlotte Area! We're going to start out at [Ass Clown Brewing](http://www.assclownbrewing.com/contact-2/), a couple miles north of the city in Cornelius. Home to over 200 unique beers, [including 14 that they brew throughout the year](http://www.assclownbrewing.com/year-round-beers//), Ass Clown is a great place to try a variety of styles. Their website indicates that they sometimes have food trucks on Saturdays, but if not there are several pizza places in the area that deliver easily.To give everyone an update on how things are going to be progressing moving forward with the meetup, I'm going to be having the out of Charlotte breweries restricted to Saturday's from now on, and probably start those meetups a bit earlier (probably around 4) than in the past. This should give those who want to come to these out of Charlotte meetups a reprieve from traffic that would be a problem during the week. I'm also going to start trying to work with the breweries that are closed on Tuesdays in Charlotte to see if they will open for us, since we bring in so much business. The first of these are going to start with Thirsty Nomad in a month or two, as a proof of concept. If things continue to go well as we expand the meetup like this, I'm going to start looking into full day trips once every few months, but that is a long way down the line.Thanks to everyone who has taken this meetup from just myself at a brewery at one point a little over a year and a half ago, to what it is today with nearly 30 people every week, and here's to the future!

Thanks to all who provided some valuable input! I'm nervous but exited for a new chapter in my career.&nbsp;Now onto business. First, let me stress that **I do not have any real bearing on management decisions here for hiring potential candidates.** This post is not any sort of guaranteed employment for whoever responds to it. I just want to help vet potential candidates as best I can, and point people in this company's direction.I'm leaving at what is pretty much the worst possible time. People have vacations coming up, and the busier months are upon us. This position has afforded me a great chance to get my feet wet in the industry, especially being someone with no on paper experience prior to taking this position. The owner of this location has also treated me really well. For those reasons, I want to do what I can to make a transition to someone new as speedy and smooth as possible.This position would be a great opportunity for a technically minded individual who may want to take a first step into IT. Even if IT isn't a career aspiration, someone with experience building and troubleshooting PC's would be a good fit as well.&nbsp;I don't want to list the actual location out of desire for privacy but feel free to PM for specifics and more info.Day to day duties/requirements are as follows:- Check in customers using front desk ticketing system- Provide hardware and software support to a variety of desktop and laptop computers and other devices both in person and over the phone (Phone support is not really a provided service here, but the ability to convey knowledge over the phone is *extremely* beneficial. That being said, being comfortable on the phone is a plus )- Maintain detailed documentation of processes and procedures used to diagnose checked in devices - Emphasize the use of preventative maintenance and data backup services - Research and provide quotes and any ordering information for system hardware/software repairs and/or upgrades - Effectively communicate diagnoses and available solutions to customers in a concise and easy to understand manner - Provide excellent customer service while resolving issues quickly and to the clientâ€™s satisfaction- Knowledge of disk imaging software, command line, and DOS based programs is a plus, though not really required.- Assist sales team by providing information on products to customers as needed (this is not absolutely required, but a bonus for sure)The environment here is super relaxed and great for someone who isn't turned on by corporate workplaces and too much oversight. If you're someone who is interested in learning and growing in technology, and are able to maintain a steady work flow, this would be a great place to start! If you have *any* questions or would like more specifics, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message.

It's a great opportunity. The more emotional, and stress averse side of me hates the idea of working the new positions hours and the inevitable missing out that would come with them.Just looking for perspective from others who've encountered similar dilemmas. What's contract work like? What do you value in a job?Edit: Thanks so much for your input everyone! r/Charlotte is awesome.

6lu6a1,Apartment Question (yes I searched),1,"Hey all. Just moved to Charlotte 5 days ago, and while the city is incredible, and we LOVE it, the Apartment (really close to UNCC) we moved into kind of turns into ""The hood"" at night, which offers some safety implications... I don't think I really need to say anymore. In short, we can't see ourselves living here long-term. We're looking for an area where the young professionals hang out, as we both have our Master's degree (we're both 25), and would like to meet some like-minded people. We kind of feel trapped because we can't really use any of the facilities at night because of the aforementioned reasons... for instance, just two days ago there was broken glass in the pool, and people left all of their garbage scattered all over the place... the grills are constantly filthy.. etc. (speaks a great deal of the people we're co-existing with).The IDEAL place would be a reasonable (20-30 minute) commute to UNC, where my girlfriend will be working. I'm also applying for jobs in the area. It APPEARS that Uptown would be the place for it to live for that (please correct me if I'm wrong), but we're open to any suggestions. Now, another thing which is presenting us some problems... the apartments in Uptown all seem to have a 1-car rule.

Not sure how I started getting Bishops posts (probably transfered from Rucho's.) The first one I got was saying I could meet him if I ponied up a thousand for a dinner during the holiday season. Love me some fundraisers /s.Anyhow, I thought I'd just paste this here in an effort to keep communication open. I know Jackson hits up our NC efforts and is appreciated for doing so--might be good to keep an eye on the other side of the aisle where the centripetal spin feels higher. If anyone wants to break reality into this I'm always up for a good read.> Legislative Update Summary of 2017 Long Session July 2017 From the desk of Sen. Bishop:> The 2017 Regular Session of the North Carolina General Assembly adjourned in the wee hours Friday, June 30, following the inevitable, two-week frenzy of late nights and sometimes heated negotiations.  The two top stories from this session â€” the fourth consecutive long session under Republican control â€” both arise from our $23 billion biennial budget, enacted notwithstanding the governorâ€™s veto.>First, continued spending discipline is ushering state government into an era of unprecedented fiscal soundness, especially relative to other states.  For the first time ever, the state savings reserve or â€œrainy day fundâ€ù balance will meet the statutory target of 8% of the general fund budget ($1.82 billion).  Future budgets will progress toward a new target of 12%. >We have begun to confront the practice of mortgaging our childrenâ€™s future through massively unfunded state employee retirement benefits.  North Carolinaâ€™s unfunded retiree health and pension obligations, accrued over many years, exceed $6,000 per capita.  The good news is that we are better off than many other states, such as Illinois (almost $21,000 per capita) and Connecticut (almost $14,000 per capita).  The better news is that we are addressing the issue from a position of budget strength and strong credit rather than the constraints of deficits and heavy debt.  This yearâ€™s $.5 billion annual revenue surplus was the third in a row since the 2013 fundamental tax reform.>Under our budget, following the lead of the private sector, the State will end the practice of promising free, but unfunded, retiree health benefits-for-life to new hires by 2021.  One result will be to enable the State in due course to improve current employee compensation.  In fact, we have begun to do so for public school teachers, and this budget continues that progress.  It provides for the fourth and fifth consecutive annual pay raises for teachers (beyond step increases), averaging 10% over the biennium.>Second, continuing the balancing act that has distinguished North Carolina from every other state in the country, we have budgeted another installment of tax relief for North Carolinians even as we further solidify the fiscal structure of our state.  Reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates will reinforce the business environment that corporate recruiters have ranked #1 in the nation and that has yielded better-than-average personal income growth and an influx of talent fleeing basket-case states like IL and CT.  A further increase in the standard deduction (the â€œzero bracketâ€ù) â€” to $20,000 â€” will take thousands more off the tax rolls, boosting citizens of modest incomes.>One notable person termed this budget irresponsible â€” in fact, â€œthe most irresponsible ever.â€ù  To me, that rhetoric serves as a reminder that even as it becomes more tempting to take for granted the Republican General Assemblyâ€™s string of budget successes, an opposition waits in the wings to return North Carolina to the budget deficits and the pay-to-play, special interest dominance of yesteryear.  That would mean another generation of wasted opportunity.  Prosperity is a discipline, not a fate.  And in this historically poor, southeastern State, the breeze of prosperity is beginning to blow.  Letâ€™s do all we can to keep it going.>It has been the privilege of my life to support this new direction for our State.>â€”   Senator Dan Bishop",ciordia9,9,3,7,7/6/17 3:06,0.118446107,self.Charlotte,5007,Politics,60

I have never seen fireworks in any major city like this (living in DC and NYC).We tried relocating to just two blocks west of BB&T Stadium (looking down Mint St from Morehead) with at least 1000 others lined up along the same stretch, but the best one could see was the very tops of the hightest reaching displays. Some were standing on cars in the attempt to see more to no avail.I have been to privately funded fireworks that could be seen for miles. This was a huge disappointment, and organizers should have announced that the only viewing areas would be within one block of the display.Growing up in Charlotte, but now living in DC (and prior, living 3 years in NYC), I wasn't expecting the same level of fireworks show as those major cities with their noted history of amazing Independence Day fireworks shows, but this was ridiculous, a huge disappointment, and well below standard for a city of Charlotte's size and beauty.The gorgeous Charlotte skyline could have been lit up this July 4th... Instead, it was a small time pyrotechnics show intended for viewing by only those attending the game, or in the adjacent park.A great opportunity for Charlotte that was completely wasted, and a ""black eye"" for Charlotte civic leaders.(link to photo taken from Mint and Morehead - https://imgur.com/gallery/bOjzH)",RedditReeviewer,1,0,1,7/5/17 18:51,0.071265173,self.Charlotte,5007,,0

Sadly, they do not deliver, but they have the best price I can find.I'm thinking a lift gate would be the best option - but I haven't been able to find a rental truck with a lift gate that isn't something like a huge box truck, which I really don't want to be backing down a driveway right on Woodlawn.Do any of you know an alternate solution?Also, have any of you bought your own cabinet table saws?  If so, how did you get them home and/or delivered?  Packaged for shipping, my saw will be about 400 pounds.  I'm also trying to figure out if I took the pallet apart, if two people could reasonably lift each piece of it into a truck bed or similar...if that's the case, I could just use my Element.Edit: This is the saw in question, if it helps:[Shop Fox W1851](https://www.woodstockint.com/products/W1851)",hispeedzintarwebz,6,9,2,7/3/17 23:01,0.246507937,self.Charlotte,5007,Discussion,3839

This will likely be taken up in September.- Impeachment of our State Secretary, Elaine Marshall. It feels like leadership in both chambers recognized this as a political stunt that would backfire badly, and have since backed off.- Pursuant to a federal court overturning our voter ID law, there was speculation it would make a comeback in a different form. For now, it hasn't.- A bill to allow anyone 18 and older to carry a concealed weapon without first obtaining a permit from a county sheriff's office.- A number of bills making major changes to immigration laws and penalties.- A bill that would put a $1.9 billion bond for school construction on the November 2018 ballot.- A bill to legalize and regulate fantasy sports.- A bill to close our state's rape loophole with respect to the revocation of consent.- A bill that would allow school districts in 20 counties to experiment with setting their own start and end dates to the school year.- A bill to fine drivers who block traffic in the left lane of a highway.- A bill requesting a national convention to make changes to the U.S. Constitution (i.e., ""convention of the states"" - the last one was in 1787).",JeffJacksonNC,25,51,64,7/3/17 20:57,0.116841737,self.Charlotte,5007,,0
